<p>
This document collects best practices for using the VAO OpenID
services within a portal.  A demonstration of these practices can be
seen in our
<a href="http://vaoportaltest.ncsa.illinois.edu">demonstration portal</a>
(powered by the
<a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/Products/vaologin">VAOlogin</a>
toolkit). 
</p>

<a name="intro"></a>
<h2>Introduction: The Portal Model  and Modes for Logging In</h2>

<p>
The best practices recommended here are based on a general perspective
of a portal as a collection of related URL-accessible resources.  Some
of these resources are expected to be publicly accessible (i.e. do not
requiring logging in) and some will be purely private.  Some resources
can contain different content depending on whether a user is logged in
or not.  The "home page" for the portal site is either a purely public
page or partially so (that is, its look will be different depending on
whether the user is logged in).  
</p>

<p>
The model suggest two modes of logging in users that should be
supported.  
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> <strong>The "Login" link/button (or form)</strong> </dt>
  <dd> In this mode, your portal provides on publicly accessible pages
       a "Login" link or button (or, in certain cases, a form or gadget).
       Clicking on the button will send the user to the login form; once
       successfully logged in, the user is returned to some appropriate
       welcome page.  This might either be purely private welcome page, or
       it could be an updated view of the page from which they clicked on
       the "Login" button.  <p>

       While this is perhaps the most familiar way for users to
       "enter" a portal, it is a mode that is important to support
       when the portal has documents that look different depending
       whether the user is logged in or not.   
       </dd>

  <dt> <strong>Forced login</strong> </dt>
  <dd> In this mode, the user attempts to access a purely private
       document either by clicking on a link or returning to a
       previously stored URL.  Before the displaying the private
       document, the portal will reroute the user to the login page.
       Upon successful authentication, the user is sent to view the
       private document.  
       <p>
       Usually, it helps with configuring the access control if
       the purely private (and often the partially private resources
       as well) share one of a few common base URLs.  Often, this is a
       natural consequence of the portal framework that is used. 
       </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Typically, a portal will support both modes; however, depending on the
nature of the portal, the portal developer may choose to support just
one or the other.  
</p>

<p>
What the login process looks like to the user will depend on whether
you plan to support multiple OpenID providers (or multiple federated
systems) or just VAO Logins as your sole identity provider.  If you
wish to support any OpenID provider or selected ones (e.g. Google,
Facebook), then your "Login" button will have to be either:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> a form or gadget that allows the user to choose which provider
       they wish to use, or </li>
  <li> an input box (marked with the
       <a href="http://openid.net/favicon.ico"><img
          src="http://openid.net/favicon.ico" title="OpenID Icon"/></a>
       icon) where a user enters their full OpenID identifier URL. </li>
</ul>

<p>
You may wish to support multiple OpenID providers if you don't care
who the user really is--you just want to be able to recognize them
when they return.  In this scenario, it shouldn't matter if a person
has multiple logins that they might connect to your portal with as
long as you are happy to treat those different logins as different
people.  
</p>

<p>
However, in the VO, with archive portals containing proprietary data
and the need to share data across portals, having a single identity
per user is critical.  Supporting multiple providers can get
complicated and will likely be more trouble than it is worth.  
</p>

<p>
Thus, for the simplest, most intuitive experience for your users,
<em>we recommend that you use the VAO OpenID provider as your sole
OpenID identity provider.</em>  If you already use a different,
non-OpenID single sign-on framework, you can still support VAO Logins;
recommended techniques for doing this will be forthcoming.  
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>  We are planning to integrate into the VAO service support for InCommon log-ins (through the <a href="http://www.cilogon.org/">CI-Logon project</a>).  This means users will be able to use the username and password provided by their local institution to connect to VAO portals.  Nevertheless, your portal can still integrate as if VAO was the sole identity provider.  
</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="RecommendedWorkflows"></a>
<h2>Recommended Workflows</h2>

<p>
The workflows presented illustrate how best to handle common user
handling issues using VAO OpenID Logins.  When relevent, they assume
that the VAO is the sole identity provider.  No assumptions are made
about the portal framework you use or the language you use or the OS
of the platform it runs on.  Where useful, specific examples are given
to illustrate a technique; these necessarily assume a particular
platform. 
</p>

<p>
You can see how these workflows work by visiting our
<a href="http://vaoportaltest.ncsa.illinois.edu">demonstration
portal</a>.  
</p>

<a name="LoggingUsersIn"></a>
<h3>Logging Users In</h3>

<a name="TheLoginlink"></a>
<h4>The Login link</h4>

<p>
With this mode of logging in, there will various public pages that you
will allow a user to log in from.  Such a page need not be dedicated
to logging in; it could be a small piece of screen real estate that
includes a login link or button.  We recommend that this area include
at least the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> A statement like "We support
       <a href="http://sso.usvao.org/">VAO Logins</a>", where "VAO
       Logins" links to the main page at
       <a href="http://sso.usvao.org/">http://sso.usvao.org/</a>.
       This allows people to readily find out more about VAO Logins if
       they do not know what they are. </li>
  <li> A "Login" link or button that will trigger the login process.
       The URL you put here depends some on the toolkit you are using, but
       more general information about this link is discussed below.
       </li>
  <li> A "Register" link that assumes that the user does not have a
       VAO Login yet and therefore directs the browser to the VAO
       registration page.  See the section on
       <a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/VAOLogins/RecommendedWorkflows#RegisteringNewUsers">registering
       users below</a> for details 
       </li>
</ul>

<p>
You might also include in the same general area the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> the VAO mini-icon:
       <a href="http://vaoportaltest.ncsa.illinois.edu/images/vao-si.ico"><img
          src="http://vaoportaltest.ncsa.illinois.edu/images/vao-si.ico"
          title="VAO icon"/></a>
       </li>
  <li> some indication that that the user is logged out (e.g. the
       words, "Logged Out").  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's what this looks like in our
<a href="http://vaoportaltest.ncsa.illinois.edu">demonstration
portal</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="loginpanel.png"/>
</blockquote>

<p>
The login link can point to one of two things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> a private document (e.g. a private welcome page).  This is
       essentially the same as the "Forced Login" mode; see the next
       section for tips on setting this up.  </li>
  <li> a CGI script or servlet or other service built using your
       OpenID toolkit of choice.  Using a script would allow you to return
       the user to the same page after a successful login.  If you want to
       require that your users are registered with your portal, then your
       script might also checked to see if the VAO user is locally
       registered and, if necessary, direct him to your registration page
       (see
       <a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/VAOLogins/RecommendedWorkflows#RegisteringNewUsers">registering
       users below</a>).  </li>
</ul>

<p>
You should consult with the documentation of the OpenID toolkit you
are using for how to create your login service.  The script will
require that you set two important inputs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> the VAO OpenID provider identifier:
       <tt>https://sso.usvao.org/openid/provider_id</tt> </li>
  <li> a URL in your portal that you want the user to be returned to
       upon successful authentication.  The user can be returned to the
       same page that they logged in from or sent to any other document. 
       </li>
</ul>

<p>
If after logging in, the user is returned to a page that includes a
login area, you might want the contents to change accordingly.  For
example: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li> remove the "Login" and "Register" links </li>
  <li> add a "Logout" link </li>
  <li> replace the "Logged Out" statement with one that indicates that
       the user is logged in, such as "Logged in as <em>username</em>".  
       <ul>
         <li> the VAOLogin toolkit includes a service and a bit of
              javascript that will check the log in status of the user and 
              display the username and how much time is left in the
              user's session. </li>
       </ul></li>
</ul>

<a name="ForcedLogin"></a>
<h4>Forced Login</h4>

<p>
In this mode, the user clicks on the link to a private document which
forces the user to go through the login process.  To intercept users
requires a special program that serve private documents through that
will check the user's log-in status.  Some high-level toolkits (like
<a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/Products/vaologin">VAOlogin</a>)
can provide such a program, sometimes requiring only configuration.
With lower-level OpenID libraries, you may have to implement this
yourself.  In either case, the important inputs are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> the VAO OpenID provider identifier:
       <tt>https://sso.usvao.org/openid/provider_id</tt>, </li>
  <li> either,
       <ul>
         <li> an identifier for (or path to) private document being
              requested, or </li>
         <li> paths to areas containing private documents. </li>
       </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
The <tt>mod_auth_openid</tt> plugin for the Apache web server can
support the "Forced Login" mode just through configuration.  With this
plugin, you configure paths containing private documents in the
<tt>httpd.conf</tt> file
by defining "<tt>&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>" nodes with the following
directives included: 
</p>

<pre style="border: 1pt solid black; background-color: #eeeeee;">   AuthType             OpenID
   require              valid-user
   AuthOpenIDSingleIdP  https://sso.usvao.org/openid/provider_id
</pre>


<a name="sess"></a>
<h3>Maintaining User Sessions</h3>

<p>
You should institute some way to track a user's session within your
portal system such as setting and tracking your own cookies.  Cookies
can be set to expire, and by testing the cookie's validity you can
tell if the user is still logged in.  Once a session has started, you
should rely on this test control access to private information.  If
you do not, your system may well route the user to the VAO service
every time they access a private link, incurring an unnecessary
network overhead.  The user won't be forced to continually enter their
password, but they might notice the poor performance.  
</p>

<p>
If you don't care too much who the user is, simply setting a cookie is
sufficient for tracking the user.  However, with most VO and archive
use cases, the user will have some state or private datasets that
persist between session; therefore, you will care who they are.  Thus,
you will need to provide some mechanism for persisting the user's
identity and associated session identifier on your portal server.
(Placing the user's identity in the cookie itself is not particularly
secure as it is possible that the user could manipulate this file.)
For example, you might have a session table in your portal database.
Some toolkits like <tt>mod_auth_openid</tt> or
<a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/Products/vaologin">Products/vaologin</a>
can do this for you if you don't have a native means in your portal
system.  
</p>

<p>
Note that the user's <a
href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/VAOLogins/Glossary#opidurl">OpenID
URL</a> can serve as a unique identifier for the user.  As explain in
our
<a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/VAOLogins/OpenIDFeatures#RepresentingUsersInternalToYourPortal">OpenID
Features document</a>, the user's username can be derived from this
URL.  Alternatively, OpenID attribute exchange can
<a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/VAOLogins/OpenIDFeatures#availableatts">provide
the username directly</a>, if that that is desired.  
</p>

<p>
Global VAO sessions last by default for 8 hours.  You may set your
session for less or more than that, if you wish.  If your portal
session ends before the global VAO session, the portal session will be
silently renewed the next time the user accesses a private document.
Similarly, there are no bad side effects of the portal session lasting
longer than the VAO session, unless you are using a user certificate
which may go stale prematurely.  If you use certificates, you should
keep your portal session equal to or shorter than the VAO session.  
</p>

<p>
Finally, you might notice on our
<a href="http://vaoportaltest.ncsa.illinois.edu">demonstration portal
page</a> (near the VAO glyph) an indication of the users login status;
it will either say "Logged out" or "Logged in as ...".  This
accomplished by a lightweight service on the portal (that returns some
user session information based on the session cookie) and a bit of
Javascript in the web page (to display the session information).  This
can be helpful to the user but is not required for integrating with
VAO Login services.  
</p>


<a name="LoggingUsersOut"></a>
<h3>Logging Users Out</h3>

<p>
To log users out of your portal, provide a link with a label like "log
out" which points to a service which simply destroys the user session
(e.g. deletes the session cookie).  This service should return the
user to a publicly accessible page that visually indicates that the
user is no longer logged in.  (That page would typically feature a
login link to log back in with.)
</p>

<p>
Note ending the user's session in your portal does not end the user's
global VAO session.  If that global session is still valid, then if
the user reclicks the "login" link on your portal, they will not be
prompted to give a password; they will automatically switched to a
logged in state again.  
</p>

<a name="DirectingNewUsers"></a>
<h3>Directing New Users</h3>

<p>
When a user visits your portal for the first time, you will want to
establish them as a user of your portal.  You may want them to
explicitly register with your portal so that you can <em>(a)</em>
collect some user information from them and/or <em>(b)</em> set up
some state (or "space") for them on your portal server.  The new user
may have a VAO login already or they may not.  Either way, you will
want direct them in the right direction to get them recognized as a
user.  
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/VAOLogins/RecommendedWorkflows#LoggingUsersIn">Above</a>,
we recommended including a "Register" link next to your portal's
"Login" link.  It can be helpful to provide a bit more information for
new users on your portal's public home page.  That is, in the area
where you welcome new users and invite them to get a login, we
recommend that your home page include the following:  
</p>

<ul>
  <li> a statement that says "We support
       <a href="http://sso.usvao.org/">VAO Logins</a>", where "VAO
       Logins" links to the main page at
       <a href="http://sso.usvao.org/">http://sso.usvao.org/</a>.
       This allows people to readily find out more about VAO Logins if
       they do not know what they are. </li>
  <li> a link for directing those who <em>do not</em> already have a
       VAO login (e.g. "If you don't already a VAO account, get one
       now..."). </li>
  <li> a link for directing those who <em>do</em> have a VAO login
       already.  If you require local registration, then this link should
       point to your local registration page (as described below);
       otherwise, this link can be your regular "login" link. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's how we do this in the
<a href="http://vaoportaltest.ncsa.illinois.edu">demonstration
portal</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="registerexample.png" />
</blockquote>

<a name="beforevao"></a>
<h4>Users who do not have a VAO Login</h4>

<p>
If the user does not have a VAO Login yet, you will want to send them
to the VAO Login registration page.  The VAO registration page
supports a special parameter that will return the user to your portal
once the registration process is complete.  That is, your link
directing users to the VAO registration page should take this form:
</p>

<blockquote>
<tt>https://sso.usvao.org/register?returnURL=</tt><em>[url_back_to_your_portal]</em><tt>&amp;portalName=</tt><em>[title_for_your_portal]</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
where <em>[url_back_to_your_portal]</em> is the URL you want users to
return to and <em>[title_for_your_portal]</em> a human-friendly name
for your portal.  If you want users to fill out a registration form,
then the return URL should be the URL to your registration page (be
sure to read
<a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/VAOLogins/RecommendedWorkflows#RegisteringNewUsers">Registering
New Users</a> below); otherwise, it can just be your normal login
link.  Be sure to URL-encode the parameter values (e.g. replace spaces
with <tt>+</tt>, question marks with <tt>%3F</tt>, and ampersands with
<tt>%26</tt>).  For example, the
<a href="http://vaoportaltest.ncsa.illinois.edu">demonstration portal</a>
uses the following URL:
</p>

<pre>
https://sso.usvao.org/register?returnURL=http://vaoportaltest.ncsa.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/portal/cgi-bin/register&amp;portalName=the+Acme+Archive
</pre>

<p>
When the user follows this link, the VAO registration page will
display a friendly message reminding the user what's going on.  For
example, registrants coming in via the
<a href="http://vaoportaltest.ncsa.illinois.edu">demonstration
portal</a> see this: 
</p>


<blockquote>
<img src="registerhello.png" />
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that this message is a little nicer if your portal name starts
with "the", if applicable.  
</p>


<a name="aftervao"></a>
<h4>Users who already have a VAO Login</h4>

<p>
If the user already has a VAO Login, they can be sent directly to your
local registration (or to your login page, if you don't need them to
register).  
</p>

<a name="RegisteringNewUsers"></a>
<h3>Registering New Users</h3>

<p>
If you want to collect some information from your users by making them
fill in a registration form, then you can usually save them some
typing by taking advantage of OpenID Attribute Exchange in the
process.  That is, some of the information that you will probably
want--like the user's real name, an email address, etc.--is
information that VAO has already collected (seconds before, in fact,
if the user just created their VAO login).  Through the OpenID
protocol, we can send your portal this information (with the user's
consent).  Then, when you present your registration page, you can
pre-populate it with this information.  You are not <em>required</em>
to do this, but it will make your users happier.  
</p>

<p>
To accomplish this, you should:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Install your registration page as one of your protected pages
       within your portal.  This will force the user to login prior to
       registration.  If they are logged in, you know their identity.  
       </li>
  <li> Use OpenID Attribute Exchange to request any of the
       <a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/VAOLogins/OpenIDFeatures#availableatts">user
       attributes available from the VAO</a>.  </li>
  <li> Fill in the appropriate parts of the form with the attributes
       returned from the VAO through the OpenID login process.  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Step 3 above implies using a script (or other dynamic page generation
scheme like JSP) to present the registration page.  How the attributes
are made available to your script depends on the library or toolkit
you use to handle the OpenID login process.  The
<a href="http://findingscience.com/mod_auth_openid/">mod_auth_openid
Apache plugin</a>, for example, makes these available as CGI
parameters; the
<a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/Products/vaologin">VAOlogin</a>
can make them available as CGI environment variables.  If you are
working directly with a language-specific OpenID library, then that
libraries API will provide access to the values.
</p>

<p>
When your registration form gets submitted, your action script would
typically load the information into a database of some kind.  Be sure
this information includes an identifier for the user.  This can be the
<a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/VAOLogins/OpenIDFeatures#VAOsOpenIDIdentifiers">user's
OpenID URL</a>.  If you prefer something shorter, you can use the
user's VAO username which is derivable from the URL or can be
retrieved as the
<a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/VAOLogins/OpenIDFeatures#availableatts">username
attribute</a>; see
<a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/VAOLogins/OpenIDFeatures#RepresentingUsersInternalToYourPortal">this
discussion of user identifiers</a> for more information.

<h3>Connecting VAO Identities with Internal Identities</h3>

<p>
As just discussed in the previous section, when you register a new
user, you record the user's unique identifier (i.e. her OpenID URL,
her username, or her qualified username).  Henceforth, if the user
creates any new datasets or state in your portal, you can assign
ownership by assigning associating them with that identifier.  In some
cases, such as with a guest-observer archive, you may have datasets
that belong to the user <em>before</em> the user has visited and
registered with the sight.  The challenge there is that when the user
registers, you must determine which datasets in the archive belong to
the user.  That is, you must some match user's VAO identity with an
identity that you already have (say, in a proposal database).  This
challenge is not peculiar to using VAO identities; rather, it is
peculiar to a use case that is common in astronomy. 
</p>

<p>
How you do this can depend on your circumstances and what information
you already have about the user, but here are some suggestions.  
</p>

<p>
First, if you already have an email address for the user, you match
the user by matching against the one you receive through the
registration process.  This method has two shortcomings:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> The user may have multiple email addresses or otherwise have
       changed their address since the original one was recorded. 
       </li>
  <li> If your registration process allows the user to enter their
       email address (or update the one received from VAO through OpenID
       Attribute Exchange), then a malicious user could easily put in
       someone else's email address to gain access to their data.  
       </li>
</ul>

<p>
There are a few techniques you can use to address these issues.  One
effective technique is to send the user a special invitation to
register before hand.  That is, using the email address you already
have in your database (e.g. proposal database), you send the user a
message saying that the archive contains data belonging to the user
and that to access it, the user should register with the the portal.
Include in this message a secret, one-time token that represents the
original identity and provide an input in the registration form where
they can enter it.  
</p>

<p>
What if the user doesn't respond to the invitation but rather comes
unsolitited without a token?  In this case, a similar technique can be
applied.  If you can match the registering user to an identity in your
database using their email, then you can send them a token afterward.
You then provide them with a service where they can enter the token to
claim their data.  
</p>

<p>
If you do not have matching email addresses, you can try matching
using other information from the registration form, like the user's
real name.  Of course, this kind of match is fuzzier and ambiguous,
and so your matches become candidate ones.  You may need to enlist the
user's help in identifying which datasets (or proposals or projects)
is his.  To ensure they have identified themselves and/or their data
correctly, you should send them a secret token.  You must then provide
a form where this token can be entered.  The can be sent to the
address that they've entered during registration, but be sure that the
user must be authenticated to access the form for entering the token.
Thus, you can match the token (and thus their original identity) with
their VAO identity.
