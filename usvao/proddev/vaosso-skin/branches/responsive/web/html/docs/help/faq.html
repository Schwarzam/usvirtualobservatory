<h2>A. General Questions about VAO Logons</h2>

<dl class="tmfaq">
  <dt> <a name="whatisit">A.1.</a>  What is a VAO Logon?   What is an
       "identity"?</dt> 
  <dd> <p> Also called your <em>VAO Identity</em>, it is a user name and
       password that you can use to log into web portals in the
       VO. </p>
       <p>
       Your identity also includes all your profile information such
       as your full name, institution, email address, etc.  The VAO
       Login Portal provides you with tools for managing your identity.  
       </p></dd>
       
  <dt> <a name="why">A.2. </a>Why create a VAO Logon? </dt>
  <dd> <p>
       Because your VAO logon is supported at a number of VO portals,
       you will now have fewer usernames and passwords to keep track of.  
       </p>
       <p>
       Your VAO login name gives you added power while working in the VO
       through its <em>single sign-on</em> capabilities--once
       you're logged into the VAO, you can move freely between portals
       without retyping you password.  More importantly, portals and
       services can pass private data back and forth securely with
       each other on your behalf.
       </p> </dd>

  <dt> <a name="howget">A.3.</a> How do I get a VAO Logon? </dt>
  <dd> <p> You can create your logon by
       <a href="/register/">filling out the VAO registration
       form.</a>  We'll then send you a quick email confirmation which
       you must respond to so that we know you are contactable and not
       a robot.  Once that is done, you'll set your username and
       password, and you're done. </p></dd>

  <dt> <a name="diff">A.4.</a> How is this different from (or similar to)
       other federated login systems?</dd>
  <dd> <p>
       The VAO Login Services uses the <a href="http://openid.net">OpenID</a>,
       a community standard for <a href="#why">federated, single
       sign-on authentication</a>.  This same standard is supported by
       widely across the web (including Google and Facebook).  In this
       way, VAO Logins are similar to the Google and Facebook OpenID
       Login services.  
       </p>
       <p>
       The most important way the VAO Login Services is different from
       other OpenID services is it provides special support for
       interoperability between VO services using X.509 certificates
       (in accordance with standards by the
       <a href="http://www.ivoa.net">International Virtual Observatory
       Alliance, or IVOA</a>).  
       </p>

  <dt> <a name="whatoid">A.5.</a> What is OpenID?  Do you support it?</a>
  <dd> <p><a href="http://openid.net">OpenID</a> is a community standard
       for federated, single sign-on authentication through the web.
       Yes, we support it (but more on that below).
       </p><p>
       Widely supported across the web, OpenID allows a user to log
       into many web sites with a single username and password.  When one
       logs into a OpenID-compatible site (i.e. a portal), the user's
       browser is sent to the <em>OpenID provider's</em> web site to
       enter a password.  Thus, a user's password is never shared with the 
       portal.  The <a href="/">VAO Login Services</a> serve as an
       OpenID provider.
       </p>
       <p>
       OpenID also supports a secure way to share user information
       (like full name and email address)
       between the provider and the portal in a way that respects the
       user's privacy.  In particular, before the VAO service will
       share any information with a portal, it asks for the user's
       permission.  
       </p>
       <p>
       The VAO Login Services complies with the standard for OpenID
       providers; however, typical use may appear a little different
       from other providers.  
       An OpenID identity is usually given in the form of a URL.
       While the VAO Login Services supports this form, VAO users
       typically do not see or enter this URL to login; instead, they
       use a short, more traditional username.  
       </p>

  <dt> <a name="nonvointerop">A.6.</a> Can I use my OpenID with non-VO
       portals and web sites? 
  <dd> <p>Often, yes, but it depends on the web site.  That is, many sites
       will accept a login from any OpenID provider.  In this case,
       the user typically enters their OpenID URL instead of a
       username.  (See <a href="#openidid">B.5</a> for information
       about your VAO OpenID URL.)  However, some web site
       administrators may choose to only accept logins from certain
       OpenID providers. </p></dd>

  <dt> <a name="nonvoid">A.7.</a> Can I use my <em>XXX</em>
       (e.g. Google) OpenID to log into VO portals? </dt>
  <dd> <p>In principle, yes, but typically no; it depends on the particular
       VO portal.  To take advantage of some of the VO portal
       interoperability features, the user needs to log in using a VAO
       login.  However, an administrator for a VAO-compatible portal
       may choose to accept OpenIDs from any OpenID provider; in this
       case, a Google OpenID can be used.  Check the portal's
       documentation for details.  
       </p> </dd>

  <dt> <a name="whatoauth">A.8.</a> What is OAuth?  Do you support it?</dt>
  <dd> <p><a href="http://www.oauth.net/">OAuth</a> is another
       commmunity standard for security on the web.  It is
       complementary to OpenID in that it enables
       <em>authorization</em>--that is, permissions--across portals
       and services on the web.  That is, it provides a mechanism for
       giving one portal permission to access something that belongs
       to a user on another portal.  Permission is granted to one portal
       in the form of a secure token that can be presented to the
       second portal.  </p>
       <p> Currently, the VAO Login Services does not directly issue
       or use OAuth tokens at this time; although, we plan to add use
       soon.  Note, however, that there are VAO-compatible portals
       that do issue and use OAuth tokens with VAO Logins providing
       the authentication required.  
       </p>

  <dt> <a name="whatx509">A.9.</a> What's an X.509 certificate?  Do I
       need one? </dt>
  <dd> <p>An X.509 certificate is a standard file that securely represent
       your <a href="#whatisit">identity</a> in a electronically
       verifiable way.  You do <em>not</em> need one to use VAO Login
       Services.  </p><p>
       An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a>
       certificate is an example of a so-called
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate">
       public key certificate</a>.  It provides a way for one program
       to prove the identity of its user without the user having to
       type in a password. </p><p>
       The VAO Login Services and compatible portals <em>may</em> use
       X.509 certificates behind the scenes if necessary to enable
       interoperability between services across the VO.  For example, 
       a portal may allow you to access all of your proprietary data
       in the VO through a single tool (e.g. a vizualizer); to obtain
       access, the portal will use an X.509 certificate representing
       your identity to access secure data access services on your
       behalf.  In this application, you do not need to handle the
       certificates yourself. </p><p>
       Some desktop or grid-based tools require that you
       install an X.509 certificate onto your local computer, into the
       tool, or into your web browser.  If you need a certificate for
       this purpose, you can obtain one through our
       <a href="/openid/cred">Certificate Download Page</a>.  Most VAO
       users, however, will not need this.  </p></dd>

  <dt> <a name="privacypolicy">A.10.</a> Do you have a privacy policy?
       Terms and Conditions Agreement?</a> </dt>
  <dd> <p>Yes.  You can view the VOA Login Services' privacy policy and
       the conditions for use <a href="/privacy-policy.html">here</a>.
       </p></dd>

<h2>B. Using and Managing your VAO Logon</h2>

<dl class="tmfaq">
  <dt> <a name="howuse">B.1.</a> How do I use my VAO Logon to login
       somewhere? </dt>
  <dd> <p>Typically, a VAO-compatible portal will indicate that they
       support VAO Logins, say, on their home page and provide a
       "Login" link.  If you are not already logged in the VAO, then
       clicking on this link will send you to the login page at
       <a href="http://sso.usvao.org/openid/">sso.usvao.org</a>.  Here
       you can enter your username and password.  If you do this
       successfully, you may then be asked to confirm that it is okay
       to share certain information with the portal (if they've asked
       for any).  You are next returned back to the portal website,
       logged in and ready to go.
       If you are already logged into the VAO when you click the
       "Login" link, it is not necessary to 
       enter your username and password; you will just enter the
       portal directly.  </p>

  <dt> <a name="confirm">B.2.</a> Why am I asked to confirm that I want
       to log in to a portal? </dt>
  <dd> <p> Sometimes the portal will want information about you before
       it allows you to use it.  Usually, this information helps with
       registering you with that site: it can fill in a registration
       form with this information so that you don't have to type it in
       again.  Nevertheless, we will not share your information unless
       you give us permission to do so.  The confirmation page
       requests that permission.
       </p><p>
       Some portals have registered with us as being VAO-compatible
       and have agreed to our <a href="/privacy-policy.html">privacy
       policy</a>.  If we notice that you are logging in from a
       recognized portal, we'll tell you on the confirmation page; you
       can feel more confidant about sharing your information from
       these portals.  If we don't recognize the portal, you should
       pay closer attention who the portal represents and what its
       purpose is when deciding to share your information.  This is
       especially true if the portal is asking for a secure
       certificate.  
       </p><p>
       When you give your confirmation, you will have the choice to
       allow VAO Login Service to remember you choices via a check
       box.  If you check this box, you will not see the confirmation
       page the next time you visit the site.  You can change these
       choices later via the <a href="/openid/prefs">preferences
       page</a>.  </p> </dd>

  <dt> <a name="whyshare">B.3.</a> Why do you share some of my personal
       information? </dt>
  <dd>  <p> Often, users are required to <em>register</em> with a
       portal before they can use it.  As part of registration, users
       must provide information about themselves.  When he VAO Login
       Service can provide any of this registration data to the portal
       upon request, it can save the user having to type it in again.  
       </p> </dd>

  <dt> <a name="move">B.4.</a> What if I move to a new home institution
       or change my email address? </dt>
  <dd> <p>You can change your person profile information, which includes
       the name of your home institution, your telephone number, your
       home country, and your  email address, using our
       <a href="/openid/prof">Profile Editing Page</a>.  By
       updating your information when you move, the new data can make
       its way out to all the VO portals you visit the next time you
       visit them.  </p></dd>

  <dt> <a name="openidid">B.5.</a> You say VAO Logons uses OpenID.
       What's my OpenID URL?  How do I use my VAO OpenID to log into
       non-VAO sites?  </dt>
  <dd> <p>An OpenID identity is represented as a URL.  Normally, VAO
       users don't make use of this URL directly; instead, they log in
       using a traditional username (which is shorter and easier to
       remember than a URL.  However, if you want to log into a
       non-VAO site using OpenID, you would use the URL-form of your
       VAO identity.  </p><p>
       A VAO user's OpenID URL has the following form:
       <blockquote>
       <code>http://sso.usvao.org/openid/id/</code><em>username</em>
       </blockquote>
       where <em>username</em> is the username you usually log in
       with.  You can use this URL to log into a non-VAO-compatible
       portal if supports logins from any OpenID provider.  Simply
       enter this URL where prompted for an OpenID. </p><p>
       Note if you control your own web-site, the OpenID standard
       allows you to define you own OpenID URL.  Consult the
       <a href="http://www.openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html">OpenID
       standard</a> for details. </p>

  <dt> <a name="passwd">B.6.</a> I forgot my username! What can I do?</dt>
  <dd> <p>Visit our <a href="/register/password.jsp">Password
       Management Page</a> to reset your password.  As part of the
       process, we'll send you a secret token by email that you will
       use to reset your password. </p></dd>

  <dt> <a name="username">B.7.</a> I forgot my username! What can I
       do?</dt>
  <dd> <p><p>Visit our <a href="/register/password.jsp">Password
       Management Page</a> to request an email that will remind you of
       your username (or <a href="#multiple">usernames</a>).
       </p></dd>

  <dt> <a name="multiple">B.8.</a> Can I have more than one login?</dt>
  <dd> <p>We discourage users from having more than one login.  This
       makes interoperability between archives and portals harder.  
       </p><p>
       Nevertheless, it's not uncommon for a user to unknowingly
       register with the VAO multiple times.  (For example, a user may
       have forgotten having registered before.)  The
       <a href="/register/password.jsp#remind">Username Reminder
       Tool</a> on the
       <a href="/register/password.jsp">Password Management Page</a>
       allows you to find all of the usernames associated with any of
       your email addresses.  If you wish to disable any usernames
       you do not use, do not hesitate to contact us at
       <strong><em>vaosso at ncsa.illinoi.edu</em></strong>.  </p></dd>

  <dt> <a name="shareid">B.9.</a> Do you support group accounts?  Can I
       share a login? </dt>
  <dd> <p> VAO Logins does not support group accounts, and sharing a
       VAO login among multiple users is <em>strongly
       discouraged.</em>  You should not share your password with
       another user.  
       </p><p>
       VO-compatible archives should instead support authorization
       groups in which distinct users can be added as members and have
       access to common collections of data.  VAO Login Services
       itself does not currently support authorization groups, but we
       may in the future to support data sharing across the VO.
       </p></dd>

  <dt> <a name="phish">B.10.</a>  Should I be worried about phishing
       through a copy-cat site? </dt>
  <dd> <p>
       Yes, but there is an easy way to avoid it.  The VAO Login page,
       <a href="https://sso.usvao.org/openid/">https://sso.usvao.org/openid/</a>,
       uses SSL to ensure a secure, encrypted login process.  SSL
       requires that sites verify they are who they say they are with
       a site certificate that can be check by your browser.  If this
       site verification is successful, your browser will indicate
       this by URL location bar; here's what Firefox looks like:
       </p>
       <img src="sslverified.png">
       <p>
       Firefox shows a lock icon to indicate that the site is
       verified.  Hovering over the lock with your mouse will show the
       name of the certificate authority ("Internet2") used to verify
       the site (see also <a href="#ssl">Question B.11</a>).  
       </p>
       <p>
       <strong><em>Look for this lock icon</em></strong> and
       <strong><em>confirm that the location is

  <dt> <a name="ssl">B.11</a>  What is meant by "verified by
       Internet2/InCommon" refer to? 
  <dd> The VAO Login page,
       <a href="https://sso.usvao.org/openid/">https://sso.usvao.org/openid/</a>,
       uses SSL to ensure a secure, encrypted login process and to
       prevent phishing attacks (see <a href="#phish">Question
       B.10</a>).  This requires us to provide to browsers a
       certificate that certifies that we are who we say we are.  
       Our site certificate has been issued by the
       <a href="http://www.incommon.org/cert/">Internet2
       InCommon Certificate Authority</a> (used by many US
       universities) which is recognized by all major browsers
       automatically.  We note this fact on our login page via the
       statement:

       <blockquote>
       This page is served from <b>sso.usvao.org</b>, 
       <a href="/help/faq.html#phish">verified by Internet2/InCommon</a>
       </blockquote>

       <p>
       This statement lets users know that they can confirm that they
       are using a legitimate login service by looking at their
       browser's URL location bar.  See <a href="#phish">Question
       B.10</a> for more details.

<h2>C. For Portal Developers/Maintainers: Supporting VAO Logons</h2>

<dl class="tmfaq">
  <dt> <a name="support">C.1.</a> I run a web site.  How do I support VAO
       Logons? </dt>
  <dd> <p>Consult our <a href="support.html">documentation for portal
       developers</a> for details.  The VAO Login Services
       <a href="#whatoid">uses OpenID</a> as the mechanism for logging
       into a portal.  Since the VAO service is fully
       OpenID-compliant, you can use any OpenID library to support VAO
       logins; our <a href="support.html">support documentation</a>
       can advise on VAO-specific features (such as what user
       attributes we can provide).  Note, though, that the VAO also
       provides a customized toolkit called
       <a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/Products/vaologin">VAOLogin</a>
       which is designed to make it easier to integrate support for
       VAO Logins.  </p> </dd>

  <dt> <a name="integrate">C.2.</a> My web site already uses 
       federated/single sign-on logins, and it's not OpenID.  Can I also
       support VAO Logons?
  <dd> <p>Yes.  Soon, we will publish through our <a href="support.html">
       portal developers' support page</a> recommended ways to augment
       your portal to support VAO Logins.  This will allow you to use
       your own single sign-on system while still support
       interoperability with other VO portals.  </dd>

  <dt> <a name="certs">C.3.</a> Must my site support X.509
       certificates in order to support VAO Logins?</dt>
  <dd> <p>No.  Use of X.509 certificates are optional.  </p><p>
       You only need to support certificates if you want your portal
       to be able to access secured VO services at another VO site.
       The <a href="support.html">portal developers' support page</a>
       describes how to obtain a temporary certificate representing a
       user as part of a VAO user session.  The
       <a href="http://dev.usvao.org/vao/wiki/Products/vaologin">VAOLogin
       toolkit</a> can handle this transparently.  
       </p> </dd>

       glossary somewhere? </dt>
