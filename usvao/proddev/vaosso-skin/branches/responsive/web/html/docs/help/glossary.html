  <dd> the action or process that must be taken to prove that an
       <a href="#entity">entity</a> (e.g. user) is who they claim to
       be.  A user often authenticates by providing a password; a web
       site authenticates itself to web browsers by presenting a
       certificate.  Authentication involves at least two parties:  an
       <a href="#entity">entity</a> that claims to have a particular
       <a href="#identity">identity</a> and an
       <a href="#entity">entity</a> that needs to prove the identity
       in order to allow an interaction between them.  The former
       usually presents <a href="#credential">credentials</a> of some
       kind, and the latter will apply some test on the credentials to
       determine if they are authentic.        </dd>
       
  <dt> <a name="authorization">authorization</a> </dt> 
  <dd> the permission (or the granting of permission) to take some

       network security:  trust in particular CAs are assumed.  A CA,
       through its <span class="wikianchor" id="cacert">CA

  <dt> <a name="cid">Claimed Identifier</a> </dt>
  <dd> in the <a href="#openid">OpenID</a> standard, an
       <a href="#opid">OpenID Identifier</a> URL that represents the
       <a href="#identity">identity</a> of a user that is chosen and
       controlled by the user.  The <a href="#openid">OpenID</a> protocol
       provides a mechanism for discovering the <a href="#opep">OP
       end-point URL</a> and the corresponding <a href="#oplocal">OP-Local
       Identifier</a> for the user.  This allows the user to use a Claimed
       Identifier to log into an OpenID-supporting portal.  
       </dd>
       
  <dt> <a name="credential">credential</a> </dt>
  <dd> a general term for a set of data that proves that an entity
       (e.g. a user, a service, or some other agent) has a particular
       <a href="#identity">identity</a>--that is, they are who/what
       they claim to be.  It can be in the form of a username and

  <dt> <a name="eec">end-entity certificate</a> </dt>
  <dd> a type of <a href="#x509">X.509 certificate</a> that has been
       signed directly by root <a href="#ca">Certificate Authority
       (CA)</a>.  This is as opposed to a <a href="#proxycert">proxy
       certificate</a> which has been signed by an intermediary.  An
       end-entity certificate is often long-lived--i.e. it is valid for,
       say, a few years; consequently when with its private key, it must be
       stored securely.

       a group of <a href="#portal">portals</a> agree to support for
       logging in users.  Within the federation, all portals support a
       common set of user <a href="#identity">identities</a>.  This means
       that a user can use the same identifier/username and password at any
       of the cooperating portals.

  <dt> <a name="identity">identity</a> </dt>
  <dd> in general, an attribute of an <a href="#entity">entity</a>
       that allows it to be uniquely identified.  Often, an identity is
       represented a unique name or label such as a username or URI.   
       </dd>
       
  <dt> <a name="idp">identity provider</a> </dt>
  <dd> an organization that assigns <a href="#identity">identities</a>

  <dt> <a name="oauth">OAuth</a> </dt>
  <dd> an <a href="http://oauth.net/">open community standard
       protocol</a> for delegating permission to access a network
       resource to another <a href="#entity">entity</a> on the
       network.  In other words, it is a standard mechanism that
       enables a user to allow one web site (or tool or other agent)
       to access her private data on another site.  In the protocol,
       the web site containing the private data will, after
       authenticating the user, create a secret token that is
       delivered to the <a href="#entity">entity</a> needing access.
       That entity can then present the token to the web site as proof
       that it has permission from the user to access the private
       data.  The tokens are usually short-lived (i.e. valid for a
       limited time) and can be made valid for access only to specific
       resources, as opposed to all the assets belonging to the user.
       OAuth, being about <a href="#authr">authorization</a>, is
       independent from <a href="#authentication">authentication</a>.
       The required authentication step in the OAuth protocol can be
       done via one almost any technique, including
       <a href="#openid">OpenID</a>.

       <a href="#sso">single sign-on</a> authentication.  By being
       <em>federated</em>, a group of <a href="#portal">portals</a>
       agree to support a single set of
       <a href="#identity">identities</a> and a common way to
       authenticate users; this means that a user can use the same
       identifier/username and password at any of the cooperating
       portals.  <em>Single sign-on</em> means that once the user logs
       into one portal in the federation and starts a session, the
       user does not need to re-type a password to connect to another
       portal in the federation.  
       </dd>
       
  <dt> <a name="opidurl">OpenID identifier</a> </dt>

       <a href="#op">OpenID provider</a> itself.  The
       <a href="#openid">OpenID</a> standard dictates that when a user
       (or agent acting on the user's behalf) attempts to authenticate
       with the OP Identifier (as opposed her personal identifier),
       the OP should present an interface that lets the user choose
       which <a href="#identity">identity</a> to authenticate as.  In
       the VAO federation, when a portal uses the  VAO's OP
       Identifier, the user will be presented a form where they can
       enter their user name rather than their whole
       <a href="#opidurl">OpenID identifier</a>.

  <dd> a collection of related documents and services available
       through a web site and accessed with a browser.  In the context of
       VAO Logins, a portal is specifically such a collection that requires
       logging in (i.e. <a href="#authn">authenticating</a>) in order to
       access it.  Logging in is the action that allows a user to "enter" a
       portal.  In OpenID-speak, a portal is an <a href="#rp">relying party
       (RP)</a>.

  <dd> as part of <a href="#pki">public-private key
       authentication</a>, it is the token that is used to decrypt a 
       message.  The <a href="#entity">entity</a> that claims to have some
       identity holds the private key and uses it to decrypt a "challenge"
       message by others wishing to authenticate their identity.  Since
       successful decryption proves possession of the private key, it is
       the key to the identity; thus, it must be stored securely or others
       could steal the private key and assume the entity's identity.  
       </dd>
       
  <dt> <a name="pubkey">public key</a> </dt>
  <dd> as part of <a href="#pki">public-private key
       authentication</a>, it is the token that is used to encrypt a
       message.  The <a href="#entity">entity</a> that wishes to prove
       another's <a href="#identity">identity</a> is given a public key
       that it will use to encrypt a message. It will send that message to
       the entity claiming the identity as a challenge: the entity that can
       decrypt it proves that they have the associated private key.  Public
       keys are intended to passed around freely; however, as part of a
       <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>, the key is signed by a
       <a href="support.html#trustedentity">trusted entity</a> (e.g. a
       <a href="#ca">CA</a>).  The signature essentially indicates
       that the holder of the private key has the
       <a href="#identity">identity</a> described in the certificate.

  <dt> <a name="pki">public-private key authentication</a> </dt>
  <dd> the authentication mechanism at the core of
       <a href="#x509">X.509 certificate</a> authentication.  It uses
       a type of encryption that involves two keys: a "public" one for
       encrypting and and a "private" one for decrypting. In the
       authentication process the <a href="#entity">entity</a>
       claiming an <a href="#identity">identity</a> presents a
       certificate that contains the public key.  The "challenging"
       <a href="#entity">entity</a> wishing to prove the identity
       encrypts a message using the public key and gives it back to
       the claiming entity.  The claiming entity has the private key
       and uses it to decrypt the message and send back the result.
       By demonstrating decryption, the claiming entity proves they
       have the private key.

  <dt> <a name="proxycert">proxy certificate</a> </dt>
  <dd> a type of <a href="#x509">X.509 certificate</a> that is that is
       a temporary stand-in for a long-term certificate.  A proxy
       certificate has been signed using an intermediate rather than by a
       <a href="#ca">root CA</a> (as with an <a href="#eec">end-entity
       certificate</a>).  A proxy is usually presented as the end of a
       chain of certificates in which each has been used to sign the
       certificate after it; at the other end of the chain is a certificate
       signed by a trusted <a href="#entity">entity</a> (e.g. a
       <a href="#ca">root CA</a>).  
       <p>
       A proxy certificate is created for actual service interactions
       to be safer than an <a href="#eec">end-entity certificate</a>
