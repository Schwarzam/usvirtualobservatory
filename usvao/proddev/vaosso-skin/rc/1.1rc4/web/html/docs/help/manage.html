<h1>Managing Your VAO Identity</h1>

<p>
Once you have <a href="/register/">gotten a VAO Login</a>--also
referred to as your <em>VAO Identity</em>--this portal gives you a few
tools for managing your identity.  Described below in more detail
(click on the link), these tools include:
</p>

<blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="#profile">Profile Editing Page</a> </dt>
  <dd> View and update our information about you (email, institution,
       phone, etc.). </dd>

  <dt> <a href="#prefs">Privacy Preferences Page</a> </dt>
  <dd> Change what information you share with portals about you 
       (email, phone, delegated security credentials, etc.). </dd>

  <dt> <a href="#cert">Certificate Download Page</a>
  <dd> Download an X.509 certificate and private key for use with your
       desktop applications.  </dd>

  <dt> <a href="#password">Password Management Page</a>
  <dd> Change your password or request a reset by email. </dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

Perhaps you are having a specific problem with your logon.  Try
looking up your problem in our <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> section on

  <dd> <a href="faq.html#howget">A.3. How do I get a VAO Logon?</a>
       </dd>

</dl>

<p>
When you register to create a VAO login, we ask you for information
about yourself.  This is referred to as you VAO Identity Profile.
When you log into VAO-compatible portals, the portal can ask for some
or all of this information (with your permission).  Over time--say, if
you move to a new job at a different institution--you may wish to
update this information.  The <a href="/openid/prof"
target="_idp">Profile Editing Page</a> allows you to do this.  
</p>

<p>
When you <a href="/openid/prof" target="_idp">access the Profile
Editing Page</a>, you will be prompted to log into the VAO if you
aren't already logged in.  When you do, you will see a profile editing
form that is filled out with your current profile information:
</p>

<center>
<img title="the profile editing form" src="profile-edit.png"
     style="border: thin solid yellow;">
</center>

<p>
To update your information:
<ol>
  <li> Edit any of the values in the form as desired.</li>
  <li> Make sure values in the email address boxes match. </li>
  <li> Enter your password into the last field (labeled "Current
       Password") </li>
  <li> Click the "Update" button.  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
If the change is successful, a notice labeled "Updated" will appear
above the form.  An error will be reported to the screen if
<ul>
  <li> the email addresses do not match, </li>
  <li> the password is not correct, or </li>
  <li> any of the required fields are empty.  </li>
</ul>
If an error occurs, correct the values in the form accordingly and
then hit "Update" again.  Note that you cannot update your username.  
</p>

<h2>Set your Privacy Preferences</h2>

  <dd> <a href="faq.html#confirm">B.2. Why am I asked to confirm that
       I want to log in to a portal?</a> </dd>
  <dd> <a href="faq.html#whyshare">B.3. Why do you share some of my personal
       information?</a> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
When a portal wants for some information about you as part of the
login process, you will be presented with a page to confirm your
approval.  This page also gives you the option to let the VAO Login
Services remember this approval so that you are not asked again in the
future.  (If in the future the portal asks for different information
that you haven't approved, it will asked you again to confirm.)  If
you click "Remember these settings..." check-box, your approval will
be save as your <em>privacy preferences</em>.  These can be later
viewed and changed via the <a href="/openid/prefs">Privacy Preferences
Page</a>.  
</p>

<p>
When you <a href="/openid/prefs" target="_idp">access the Privacy
Preferences Page</a>, you will be prompted to log into the VAO if you
aren't already logged in.  When you do, you will see a table that
lists for each portal you have visited your current privacy
settings--that is, which profile data you have approved for sharing
with that portal:
</p>

<center>
<img title="the privacy preferences table" src="prefs-list.png"
     style="border: thin solid yellow;">
</center>

<p>
In the example above, you can see at the left the two portals that the
user has visited (the "Acme Archive" and "zinc").  At the top, the
user's current profile data is shown.  In the intersection, you see
where is says "Yes" which pieces of information have been approved for
sharing with that portal.  The "Secure Credentials" indicates whether
you will allow the portal to have a temporary certificate that will
give it access to other secure services on your behalf.  The last
column, "Always confirm sharing", indicates whether the Login service
will always display the confirmation page when the portal asks for
your information.  If you previously checked the "Remember these
settings..." box, this column will say "No".  
</p>

<p>
To change these choices, click on the "Edit" link next to the portals
name.  This will cause the view to change to an editable form:
</p>

<center>
<img title="the privacy preferences edit form" src="prefs-edit.png"
     style="border: thin solid yellow;">
</center>

<p>
You can then change your preferences by clicking on (or off) the
check-box for the profile information you are willing to share with
that portal. You can also make the login service always ask for
confirmation of these preferences when you login; do this by clicking
the check-box by "Always ask...".  To commit your changes, click
"Update these choices".  You can cancel your changes by clicking
"Cancel Choices".  Clicking either will return the view to the
listing.  Any committed changes will be shown.  
</p>

<blockquote style="border: medium ridge black; background: #eeeeff; padding: 0px 8px 0px 8px">
<dl>
  <dt> <strong><em>Which data should I share?</em></strong> </dt>
  <dd> This depends on your trust of the portal.  Portals that are
  <em>recognized</em> by the VAO as compliant portals will have a clear title 
  under the "Portal" column; when you expand that portal's row to edit
  the preferences, you will also see a short description of the
  portal.  ("Acme Archive" in the example above is a
  <em>recognized</em> portal.)  You should feel comfortable sharing
  your information with 
  recognized portals because their administrators have agreed to our
  <a href="/privacy-policy.html">privacy policy</a>.  Unrecognized
  portals will just appear as a domain name
  (e.g. "portal.archive.edu"); you should be more careful about what
  you share with these portals (particularly when it comes to sharing
  your credentials).  </dd>

<h2>Download an X.509 Certificate</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> Related <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> questions: </dt>
  <dd> <a href="faq.html#whatx509">A.9.  What's an X.509 certificate?  Do I
       need one?</a>
</dl>

<p>
In accordance with the intent of the
<a href="http://www.ivoa.net">IVOA</a>
<a href="http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/SSOAuthMech.html">security
standards</a>, we have strived to make our services compatible with
tools from the grid community.  Some desktop or grid-based tools
require that you install an <a href="#whatx509">X.509 certificate</a>
onto your local computer, into the tool, or into your web browser.  If
you need a certificate for this purpose, you can obtain one through our
<a href="/openid/cred" target="_ipd">Certificate Download Page</a>.  Most VAO
users, however, will not need this. 
</p>

<p>
When you <a href="/openid/cred" target="_idp">access the Credential
Download Page</a>, you will be prompted to log into the VAO if you
aren't already logged in.  When you do, will see the form for
requesting a certificate:
</p>

<center>
<img title="the credential download request" src="cred-form.png"
     style="border: thin solid yellow;">
</center>

<p>
In order to fill out this form, you need to understand something about
what you will get.  The credentials will come in two parts:  a public
certificate and a private key.  These will be delivered to you
combined into a single package (in one of two possible formats).  This
package is typically the form that you use to load it into an
application that needs it.  It is "sealed" with its own package
key--that is, a password--that you will set in this form; you will
need this key when you load the package into your application.  
</p>

<p>
The certificate you will get will have a temporary lifetime; you can
set how long it is valid for.  A shorter lifetime is safer: if it
is stolen, the thief has a limited time to do anything with it.  The
disadvantage is that it will need to be replaced sooner if you use the
application over an extended period.  
</p>

<p>
To retrieve a certificate, fill out the form:
<ol>
  <li> Choose how long the certificate should be valid for.  Choose
       the shortest time that is convenient for your use.  </li>
  <li> Enter a package key used to seal the credential package that
       will get delivered to you.  </li>
  <li> Choose one of the supported output formats for the package.  If
       you will be loading the certificate into a web browser or Java,
       pick "PKCS12".  If you will be loading the certificate into
       Globus, choose "PEM".  </li>
  <li> Enter you login password. </li>
  <li> Click the "Download Credential" button.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Your browser should then give you a pop-up for saving the delivered
package to your local disk.  Note that you should keep this file safe
and not accessible by other users.  
</p>

<p>
To load the credential into your application, consult your
application's documentation.  Loading the certificate into a browser
will depend on your browser.  As an example, here's how you can load
it into Firefox (ref. v12.0):
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Select "Preference" from the "Edit" menu. </li>
  <li> In the Preferences pop-up window, select the "Advanced"
       section (from the icons along the top).  </li>
  <li> Select the "Encryption" tab.  </li>
  <li> Click the "View Certificates" button to open another pop-up
       window.  </li>
  <li> Select the "Your Certificates" tab.  </li>
  <li> Click on the "Import..." button; this should bring up a file
       chooser window for selecting your credential package
       file. </li>
  <li> Navigate the filesystem to find and select your PKCS12
       credential package file.  </li>
  <li> The browser may next ask you (via another pop-up) to provide
       the password to you "Security Storage Device"; this is the
       password you use to protect your web passwords within your
       browser.  </li> 
  <li> Another pop-up will ask you for "the password that was used to
       encrypt this certificate backup".  This is asking for your
       package key.  </li>
  <li> If you entered the correct key, then the certificate will get
       loaded.  You should now see it listed in the "Your
       Certificates" tab under a section labeled "Virtual Astronomical
       Observatory".  </li>
</ol>

Sometimes you need to change your login password.  Sometimes you
forget your password.  Sometimes you might even forget your username.
The <a href="/purse/password.jsp" target="_idp">Password Management
Page</a> is here to help.  For obvious reasons, you do not need to be
logged in to access this page.  
</p>

<p>
Below we discuss:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="#change">Changing Your Password</a>          </li>
  <li> <a href="#username">Get Reminded of Your Username</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="#reset">Reset Your Forgotten Password</a>    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="change"></a>
<h3>Changing Your Password</h3>

<p>
Use the "Change Password" section of the page to change your
password.  This simple (and familiar) form requires the following
inputs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> your VAO username, </li>
  <li> your current password (i.e. what you want to change it from),
       and </li>
  <li> your new password (i.e. what you want to change it to).  You
       need to enter the same password twice and these entries must
       match to protect against typos (since you won't be able to see
       the characters you type in).  
</ul>

<center>
<img title="the change-password form" src="change-pass.png"
     style="border: thin solid yellow;">
</center>

<p>
Click the "change" button to commit your change.  You will see either
a message announcing success ("Password changed") or an error message
if there was a problem with your inputs.  Possible errors include:
<ul>
  <li> the two entries of the new password did not match. </li>
  <li> the requested password is too weak.  This can be because: </li>
       <ul>
         <li> it is too close to your username </li>
         <li> it is too short (at least 6 characters are required). </li>
         <li> it is too close to a banned word
              (e.g. "password", "123456", etc.) </li>
         <li> it contains illegal characters. </li>
       </ul> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<center>
<img title="an error in the password change request" src="change-pass-err.png"
     style="border: thin solid yellow;">
</center>

<p>
If you encounter an error, you must re-enter your passwords and click
"change" again.
</p>

<a name="username"></a>
<h3>Get Reminded of Your Username</h3>

<p>
Use the "Username Reminder Email" section of the page if you need to
be reminded of your username.  The key to this tool is knowing the
email you have registered with us.  If you have more than one email
address and you are not sure which one you used, enter all possible
email address into the text box with one address per line.  When you
click the "Remind" button, we'll check for all of them in our
database.  For each one that matches, we'll send you an email to that
address with all of the usernames associated with that address.
</p>

<p>
(Yes, it is possible to have more than one VAO account, but we
discourage this.  Sometimes, though, you just forget that you already
have one.)  
</p>

<center>
<img title="the profile editing form" src="userremind.png"
     style="border: thin solid yellow;">
</center>

<p>
If you have forgotten your username, then it's likely that you've also
forgotten your password.  For this reason, the email we send you will
include instructions for how to change your password.  In particular,
it includes a token you will need to change it via the "Reset Your
Password" section of the page (see next section). 
</p>

<a name="reset"></a>
<h3>Reset Your Forgotten Password</h3>

<p>
If you have forgotten your password you can reset it with the "Reset
Your Password" section of the Password Management Page.  This process
has a few steps that starts with entering your username into the form:
</p>

<center>
<img title="the profile editing form" src="resetpass.png"
     style="border: thin solid yellow;">
</center>

<p>
Unless you got one from a username reminder email, you won't have a
token to fill in the input box labeled "Secret Token", so you leave
that blank and press the "reset" button.  With this, we will send you
an email (to the address associated with this username) with a token
needed to proceed the reset.  When you receive the email, you can
enter the token string into the second field (or you can click on the
link provided in that email).  
</p>

<p>
Once you have resubmitted the form with the token, you will see a new
form that will let you set your password:
</p>

<center>
<img title="the profile editing form" src="newpass.png"
     style="border: thin solid yellow;">
</center>

<p>
Enter your new choice for a password twice, and click the "change"
button.  Note that this update can fail for one of the following
reasons:  
<ul>
  <li> the two entries of the new password did not match. </li>
  <li> the requested password is too weak.  This can be because: </li>
       <ul>
         <li> it is too close to your username </li>
         <li> it is too short (at least 6 characters are required). </li>
         <li> it is too close to a banned word
              (e.g. "password", "123456", etc.) </li>
         <li> it contains illegal characters. </li>
       </ul> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you encounter an error, just enter new passwords and click "change"
again.
