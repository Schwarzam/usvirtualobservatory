<h1>VAO Security and Privacy Policies </h1>

<p>
The VAO Login Services are provided to make it easier for scientists,
educators, and students to access and share proprietary data
throughout the Virtual Observatory environment.  It allows for the
establishment of a platform for research that spans across archives
and web sites that are managed by different institutions.  
</p>

<p>
This document describes the VAO Login Services terms of use, security
policies, and privacy policies.  These apply to both sites that
support VAO Logins and users that establish VAO identities to use
those sites. 
</p>

<p>
In summary, the key points from this document to keep in mind:
<ul>
  <li> Use of the VAO Login services are for legitimate scientific 
       and educational purposes.  </li>
  <li> The VAO may block users or web sites from using the VAO Login
       services that violate our terms of use.  </li>
  <li> To support a federated identity, the VAO services <em>will</em> share
       your registration data with third parties but only after securing
       explicit, "opt-in" permission from you. </li>
  <li> We employ best practices for protecting your information,
       password, and other data from unauthorized access; however, we
       recognize that in the IT world there is no absolute guarantee
       of security.  Consequently, this protection is provided on
       a best effort basis. </li> 
</ul>
You should take these points into consideration when entrusting data
into this system.  
</p>

<h2>User Data and Responsible Parties</h2>

<h3>Data Held on VAO-managed Systems</h3>

<p>
An aim of the VAO Login services is to provide secure, federated
identities across separately administered web sites and services.
When a user participates in the VAO Login framework, some data and
personal information are held by VAO-administered sites, and some by
partner sites which are not under VAO control.  Users should
familiarize themselves with the policies of both VAO and non-VAO sites
that they visit.
</p>

<p>
The VAO Login Services collects and maintains (or may do so in future)
the following information about users: </p>
<ul>
  <li> personal information requested at registration time (when a
       user creates their VAO identity).  This information is shared 
       with collaborating web sites upon permission by the user
       (though the <a href="http://www.openid.net">OpenID</a>
       protocol).  </li> 
  <li> group membership information established by users explicitly
       for sharing data with other users. </li>
  <li> other affiliation information that helps verify the true
       identity of the user and collected with the explicit
       cooperation of the user.
  <li> logs of accesses to its services by users to help users
       troubleshoot problems and to assess the effectiveness of our
       services. </li>
</ul>

<p>
The VAO project provides other services and tools that allow user to
save data associated with their VAO identity; we refer to such data
items as <em>user data products.</em>.  The user can later retrieve
their user data products and/or share them securely with other users
or web sites with the help of VAO Login services. 
</p>

<h3>Data Held on Third-party Systems</h3>

<p>
A non-VAO web site, which we refer to as a <em>third-party portal</em>,
can leverage VAO Login services to authenticate users that visit the
site; this is done through the
<a href="http://www.openid.net/">OpenID</a> protocol.  Such a site can
then store data products associated with the user's VAO identity.  A
third-party portal may wish to collect user information as part of a
registration process.  (Some of this may be collected by requesting it
from the VAO via the OpenID protocol, requiring the user's permission,
or by asking the user for it directly.)  The portal may also collect
logging information recording accesses to the site by the user.
</p>

<p>
While the VAO is not responsible for the handling of data and
information held by third-party sites, all sites that use VAO logins
are subject to the terms of use spelled out in this document.  The VAO
maintains records of sites that have explicitly agreed to these terms
and are thereby "known" to the VAO; however, sites may make use of the
open VAO login services without prior notification.  Sites that
violate the terms of use may be blocked from using VAO services.  
</p>

<h3>User Responsibilities</h3>

<p>
A user with a VAO login account (i.e. a <em>VAO identity</em>) and who
uses services protected by VAO authentication may create or download
data products in the normal course of using those services.  The VAO
is not responsible for products stored on the user's own sytems.  User data
products stored on portal web sites should not be considered safe from
loss due to system failure or human error <em>unless the site
explicitly documents such otherwise</em>; users are responsible for
backing up their own data to protect against loss.  
</p>

<p>
The VAO framework for federated identities is optimized for one login
account per user.  Multiple accounts for a single user are discouraged
but not disallowed.  Group accounts in which a single password is
shared amoung multiple users are highly discouraged.  
</p>

<p>
The VAO asks users that when they create a VAO identity that they
accept the following responsibilites:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> abide by the terms described in the "Restrictions on Use"
       below, </li>
  <li> take reasonable measures to protect their password from
       discovery by others and not to share their password with
       others, </li>
  <li> practice good "Netizenship" and conduct themselves
       professionally and courteously while logged into VAO and
       VAO-compatible portal.  </li>
</ul>

<a name="caveat"></a>
<h2>Caveat Emptor</h2>

<p>
The VAO Login services available via the site at
<a href="https://sso.usvao.org/">https://sso.usvao.org/</a> are
provided by the VAO project for research and educational purposes only.
They should not be used to support commercial or other monetary
transactions.  While we strive to ensure a high degree of security,
data integrity, and user support, these services are provided "as-is"
and on a best-effort basis, without any implied guarantees.  Users are
advised against using these services for purposes in which data loss or a
unauthorized disclosure would result in significant monetary loss or
physical damage.  The VAO, LLC shall not be held liable for loss or
unauthorized disclosure of user data or information.  
</p>

<a name="restrict"></a>
<h2>Restrictions of Use</h2>

<p>
The VAO login and data services must <em>not</em> be used for any of the 
follow purposes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> to directly support commercial or other monetary transactions, </li>
  <li> to support activities of any kind in violation of U.S. law,
       including the unlawful distribution of copyrighted or illicit
       materials, </li>
  <li> to attempt to circumvent the authentication and authorization
       mechanisms of any VAO portal or service or of any
       VAO-compatible portal or service,
  <li> to promote a hostile environment for other users, and </li>
  <li> to support uses other than those that advance scientific
       research or education unless otherwise approved by the VAO
       project.  </li>
</ul>

<p>
When an application wishes to charge a user for a service (e.g. a
conference registration fee), any collection of personal financial
information, including credit card numbers, must be done outside the
security realm protected by VAO Login services.  Sites supporting VAO
Login services must not use VAO Login services to authenticate users
to authorize access to any such financial information.  The VAO,
LLC accepts no responsibility loss or disclosure of financial
information.  
</p>
<p>
Web sites supporting VAO Logins must not attempt to capture or
cache a user's password in either encrypted or unencrypted form
without express permission to do so by VAO Login Services
administrators; user authentication must be handled only by approved
VAO services operated by the VAO and approved VAO partners.  Web sites
must not serve web pages made to look like VAO web pages without
express permission. 
</p>

<p>
The VAO reserves the right to block any user or web site that violate
these restrictions from using VAO services.  
</p>

<a name="privacy"></a>
<h2>Controlling Access to Your Information and Data</h2>

<h3>Sharing Registration Information with Permission</h3>

<p>
When you, as a user, register to create a VAO identity, you provide the
VAO with some personal information including an email address, country
of residence, etc.  When you authenticate with a web site (i.e. log
into it) using a VAO login name, the web site may request access to
any of this information.  VAO Login services <strong>will share this
registration information only after you provide explicit permission to
do so.</strong>.  This is done by presenting a page that lists the
information being requested and asks for your permission to share it.
You can choose to have the VAO remember this decision so you are not
asked again.  The VAO Login services allow you later to change this
decision at any time later. (See your
<a href="/openid/prefs">the privacy prefences page for details</a>.)
</p>

<p>
To help advise users when sharing information, the VAO keeps records
of known collaborating web sites who agreed explicitly to abide by the
VAO's terms of use; VAO services will note when such a web site is so
recognized.  
</p>

<h3>Sharing Data Products Across Sites</h3>

<p>
As a result of the VAO's system of federated identities, a user can
have data associated with their VAO identity at many different VAO and
third-party portals.  The VAO Login services can enable one portal to
access a user's products at another portal on the user's behalf.  To
accomplish this, a portal can request an X.509 certificate, a digital
data item that represents the user's identity.  The VAO will provide
the portal with the certificate only after receiving permission from
the user.  (The user can have the VAO Login services remember this
choice to provide certificates to the portal without further
permission.)  Other portals may choose to accept an X.509 certificate
as authentication of the user; thus, the portal holding the
certificate can present the certificate to services at other portals
and access the user's data.  
</p>

<p>
Access via X.509 certificates issued by the VAO Login services have
two important limitations: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li> The certificates are valid for a limited time.  This time may
       by set by the user.  The maximum validity time is limited by
       VAO policy. </li>
  <li> Depending on the policy of the portal accepting the certificate
       as authentication, the certificate <em>may</em> enable access
       to <em>all</em> data products belonging to the user.  The
       certificate does not specify internally any limitation on what
       data can be accessed or what other specific authorizations
       should be granted.  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The VAO Login services may in the future provide mechanisms that
restrict access to data and services on a finer grain level than
described above.  
</p>

<p>
To help advise users on when to allow a web site to access their data
on other sites via an X.509 certificates, the VAO maintains records of
"known" collaborating portals who have explicitly agreed to the VAO
policies and terms of service.  Users will be informed when a known
portal is requesting an X.509 certificate.  The portal should document
their services that access user data products on other sites to inform
the user what data will be access and how it will be used.  Portals
should should not access or cache data for purposes other than those
documented for the user. 
</p>

<h3>Other Information Sharing</h3>

<p>
The VAO will not share personal information including email addresses
with third parties for any reason outside of the process described
above.  The VAO will not use users' personal information for
distributing email for any purposes other than the maintenance of
users' identities.  The VAO does not condone the use of user email
addresses by third parties that have retrieved them through the
legitimate means described above for purposes other that the
administration of participating portals.  Abuse of user trust and the
intent of the VAO Login federation with regard to email address use
(such as to deliver spam) will be considered grounds for discontinuing
support for a third-party portal.  
</p>

<p>
The VAO will not share any information revealing patterns of use that
is traceable to an individual user with third parties with the
following exception:  administrators of known web sites supporting VAO
logins that have agreed to the terms of use may request through a
secure service access to information logging access (and access
attempts) to their own web sites through the VAO Login services.  This
is provided to aid in their assisting their users with login
troubles.  Web site administrators will not have access to logging
information related to other web sites.  
</p>

<p>
The VAO collects logging information to compile aggregate statistics
to understand the true usage of VAO services.  While some user
tracking may be done internally to identify related operations, this
is done without regard to the specific identity of the users.  Aggregate
statistics that do not identify individual identities may be published
publically.  
</p>

<p>
The VAO strives with best effort to protect each user's personal information,
password, and records of usage from access by unauthorized parties.
As part of this effort, we apply best practices recognized by industry
and IT security community.
