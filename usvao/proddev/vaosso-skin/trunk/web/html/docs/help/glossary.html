  <dd> the action or process that must be taken to prove that an

       site authenticates itself to web browsers by presenting a

       protocol</a> for delegating permission to access a network
       resource to another <a href="#entity">entity</a> on the
       network.  In other words, it is a standard mechanism that
       enables a user to allow one web site (or tool or other agent)
       to access her private data on another site.  In the protocol,
       the web site containing the private data will, after
       authenticating the user, create a secret token that is
       delivered to the <a href="#entity">entity</a> needing access.
       That entity can then present the token to the web site as proof
       that it has permission from the user to access the private
       data.  The tokens are usually short-lived (i.e. valid for a
       limited time) and can be made valid for access only to specific
       resources, as opposed to all the assets belonging to the user.
       OAuth, being about <a href="#authr">authorization</a>, is
       independent from <a href="#authentication">authentication</a>.
       The required authentication step in the OAuth protocol can be

       authenticate users; this means that a user can use the same
       identifier/username and password at any of the cooperating
       portals.  <em>Single sign-on</em> means that once the user logs
       into one portal in the federation and starts a session, the

       portal in the federation.

       (or agent acting on the user's behalf) attempts to authenticate
       with the OP Identifier (as opposed her personal identifier),
       the OP should present an interface that lets the user choose
       which <a href="#identity">identity</a> to authenticate as.  In
       the VAO federation, when a portal uses the  VAO's OP
       Identifier, the user will be presented a form where they can

       VAO Logins, a portal is specifically such a collection that requires
       logging in (i.e. <a href="#authn">authenticating</a>) in order to
       access it.  Logging in is the action that allows a user to "enter" a

       identity holds the private key and uses it to decrypt a "challenge"
       message by others wishing to authenticate their identity.  Since
       successful decryption proves possession of the private key, it is
       the key to the identity; thus, it must be stored securely or others
       could steal the private key and assume the entity's identity.

       that it will use to encrypt a message. It will send that message to

       authentication process the <a href="#entity">entity</a>
       claiming an <a href="#identity">identity</a> presents a
       certificate that contains the public key.  The "challenging"
       <a href="#entity">entity</a> wishing to prove the identity
       encrypts a message using the public key and gives it back to
       the claiming entity.  The claiming entity has the private key
       and uses it to decrypt the message and send back the result.
       By demonstrating decryption, the claiming entity proves they
       have the private key.
