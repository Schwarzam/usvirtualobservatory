 VOView Filter Package
 Version 1.0
 15 September 2010

This distribution installs on a Web server the files needed to use the VOView
filter class to do simple sorting and filtering of a VOTABLE.  Once that 
distribution is unpacked, the build.xml file should be edited to reflect your
server installation.  In particular, the project_root property should be
modified to point to the top of your server's file directory structure.  If
you wish to access VOTABLEs using URLs not local to the server, you will need
to configure a proxy server.  An example proxy server, proxy.pl, is included in
the distribution.  It is installed at the location specified by the property
dest_cgi.  You will also need to set the value of the filter token PROXY_URL.

Once the build.xml file is properly configured for your system, run 
"ant install" in the directory of the build file to install the distribution.
Example webpages showing how to use this distribution is installed at
/vo/develop/view/filter_test*.html by default.  These use an example input file,
example_input.xml, located in the same directory.

A test suite for this software, based on JUnit and selenium, is available under 
src/java/net/ivo/voview/tests .  There is currently no build target for these tests.
