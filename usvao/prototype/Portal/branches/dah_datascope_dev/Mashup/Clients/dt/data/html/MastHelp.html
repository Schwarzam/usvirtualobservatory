          <h2><a name="Intro" id="Intro">Introduction</a></h2>

          <p>The Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) Portal is a web application for searching repositories of information about
          Astronomical Data, Publications and Images.</p>

          <p>(Note: Throughout this user's guide there are screenshots taken from a development environment that may include features or data states
          that are not normally reachable by users. They are only meant to serve as visual guides.)</p>

          <p>The initial screen layout consists of the following components, numbered as in Fig. 1:</p>

          <dl>
            <dt><b>1. "Select Collection" Box and other basic tools</b></dt>

            <dd>Use the dropdown menu to choose the collection to search (results vary depending on the information contained within each particular
            collection). Also has a link to the "about" screen, allows a user to import a CSV or VO table they have saved on their local machine, a
            button that brings up the user's download basket (if populated), and a button for the user's guide.</dd>

            <dt><b>2. Search Box</b></dt>

            <dd>Depending on the collection chosen, a hint appears describing the kind of query that should be performed. Also contains examples that
            populate the search box for you.</dd>

            <dt><b>3. Data View Panel</b></dt>

            <dd>Presents data and images returned from the query or queries, sometimes allowing multiple views of a dataset, such as a grid layout or
            an album view. If filtering is available for the data panel, applicable filters are grouped into <em>facets</em> by semantic type, and
            will appear in this panel. Note that the Filters panel can be resized or (un)hidden using screen widgets.</dd>

            <dt><b>4. Astroview Panel</b></dt>

            <dd>This panel may be optionally loaded by the tool. It is a powerful all-sky viewer provides visualization context and
            imagery for either aribtrary positions specified within the viewer itself or while being tied to data from Portal queries. </dd>
          </dl>

          <h2><a name="Search" id="Search"></a> Initiating a Search</h2>

          <p>All searches begin by choosing a collection and entering either the name of an astronomical object, or the RA/Dec coordinates of a sky position
          in the <em>search entry box</em> in decimal degrees, sexagesimal or galactic coordinates (on the left in Fig. 2). A radius can be appended to the
          search by adding "r=" and a radius, with units of "d" (degrees), "m" (minutes) or "s" (seconds). Some collections have search radius limitations, and the default radius is
          usually 0.2 degrees. The search can be initiated by clicking the <b>Search</b> button or by pressing the <em>Return</em> key on your
          keyboard while the cursor is in the search entry box.</p>

          <table cellpadding="2" width="500">

          <p>Names of objects are passed to a name resolver (one of many Virtual Observatory services that support the Portal), which associates
          known object names with sky coordinates. A wide variety of catalog and common names can be resolved to known objects. Coordinates can be
          given in a variety of formats; right ascensions must be positive and southern declinations require a leading negative sign. Examples of
          valid names and coordinate formats are given below.</p><!-- table width="700" cellpadding="1" -->

          <h2><a name="Grid" id="Grid"></a>Exploring Search Results</h2>

          <p>A successful search, such as that shown for M57 below, populates a new <em>Search Results</em> panel with a table of resources, a
          corresponding <em>Filters</em> panel applicable to these resources, and focuses the AstroView component on the position. If the software
          detects image outlines (footprints), it will draw them, and will attempt to mark non-images, such as catalogs, by marking the position
          listed for that row. The results of subsequent searches will be stored in new tables, and can be accessed by clicking on the tabs at the
          top of the Results panel. To eliminate a results table (and discard the results for that search), click the "x" icon on the tab. Concurrent
          searches are possible; if a new search is initiated prior to the last one completing, a new tab will be created while the previous search
          continues. Just below the tabs is a status panel with the following items from left to right:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>the number of rows retrieved (and update information for searches in progress)</li>

            <li>controls for AstroView (more on these later)</li>

            <li>an <b>Export Table As...</b> button which can write the table of results to your local storage. This works in conjunction with the
            "Import Table..." link at the top of the page.</li>

            <li>the object name and coordinates from the name resolver</li>

            <li>the search radius</li>
          </ul>

          <table cellpadding="2" width="820">

                The results of a prior search/tab may be viewed by clicking the tab (labelled <b>Start Page</b> in this case) at the top of the

              </tr>
            </tbody>

          <p>The records are listed in the table, one per row. Each record represents data about a particular image, catalog or spectra, with the columns
          defining each datum about the record. In the example above, each displayed record is about an IUE spectrum that was found within the bounds
          of the search.</p>

          <h3><a name="ResultDetails" id="ResultDetails"></a>Search Details Pop-Up</h3>

          <p>Clicking on any row in the Search Results panel pops up a panel with summary information about the resource; clicking the double arrows
          at the bottom of this panel (labelled "Expand for Details") exposes all of the attributes for the resource.</p>

                Clicking the double-arrow at the lower-right of the pop-up brings up all available details. Different details panel formats exist for
                the various collections - for collections where the tool knows, for example, that there will be an image and a URL that links to a
                large-format version, it will pop up a details panel such as this one that links to it. Other image records may be displayed
                differently, and sometimes the format is unavailable, therefore the tool can only provide a generic view of the data.</font></td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          
          <h3>Virtual Observatory (VO or VAO) Search Results</h3>

          <p>For search results from the VAO, the initial list returned is only the first half of the search. It contains a list of resources from the
          VAO that claim to have data within the searched cone. These data are catalogs, images and spectra. From this list, the user must click the
          desired object to view a summary of its details. The user may then load the full data from that object by clicking on the "Load" button 
          in the Summary Panel, which will display all of its
          associated data records into a new tab for further browsing of that resource's objects, images or spectra. This action is referred to as a
          "drilldown", and is a key component of using the Portal to explore multi-tiered data hierarchies such as the VAO. Additionally, the user may
          download exactly the table, including all metadata, to a file on their local machine, or initiate another search using that resource.</p>

          <table cellpadding="2" width="870">

                shown). The "Download File" button will download the entire VO table to the user's machine as a file, including all metadata. In this
                example, the user has prepared to initiate a new M83 search using the GALEX resource, rather than querying all of the VAO again.

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <h2><a name="Filters" id="Filters"></a>Refining Results with Filters</h2>

          <p>Many searches, particularly on popular targets or of a sufficiently large area of sky, generate sometimes hundreds or even thousands of
          rows. The Filters panel allows the user to restrict the list of search results to those of most interest.</p>

          <h3><a name="FilterFacets" id="FilterFacets"></a>Facet Filters</h3>

          <p>The list of potential filters is quite large, and includes as many attributes of the matched data collections as the data providers
          offer. The filters in the panel are grouped into semantically related <em>facets</em> depending on the data. You can view the list of
          allowed facets by clicking the <b>Edit Facets</b> button at the top of the panel; select the desired facets by clicking the check-boxes in
          the pop-up window (middle) and clicking the <b>Apply</b> button. Note that not all facets are displayed or even available by default.</p>

          <p>There are three types of filters:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Discrete filters - Used for text and most integer-based facets (columns of data). A filter can be applied by clicking the check-box
            next to the desired facet values.</li>

            <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
              <ul>
                <li>A special discrete filter can exist when the data rows are selectable, allowing the user to choose whether to filter selected or
                unselected rows.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Ranged sliders - Used for continuous numeric data, some integer data, and dates. Each facet presents the user with a histogram
            approximating the distribution of the data, a 2 handled slider for constraining endpoints, and a min/max box displaying the current
            endpoints, which also allows a user to manually type the desired endpoints. Some numeric facets are known to have certain values that
            represent a null or undefined entry, and the facet will alert the user that it is ignoring such a value.</li>

            <li>A search box, which allows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a> matching by 
            searching all records and columns of the data (even ones not visible in the
            display grid).</li>
          </ul>

          <table cellpadding="2" width="700">
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><img src="../../../Shared/help/filtered_search.png" alt="Filtered Search" align="middle" border="0" /></td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td colspan="3"><font size="-1">Fig. 5&mdash; The search has been filtered for rows where the Mission is "HLA" with RA between the
                given values. This updates the counts of the other facet values based on how many other rows can be selected. For example, 29 of the
                original 58 rows where the Product Type was "image" intersect with the currently applied filters, while the "spectrum" value is
                grayed out because it cannot possibly intersect with the current selection. Regular expressions may also be used as filters by
                entering a regular expression in the dialog box near the top of the panel. In the numeric facet above, the data was recognized as RA
                coordinates and is presented in these boxes in sexagesimal format, but a user may define his or her own bounds using sexagesimal or
                degrees.</font></td>

            </tbody>
          </table>

          <h2><a name="Download" id="Download"></a> Retrieving Results</h2>

          <p>A core capability of the MAST Portal is to enable users to download resources, or to direct them to other desktop applications for
          analysis. As used here, <em>resources</em> is a rather generic term used to refer to individual data files (images, tables, and the like),
          or collections of them, or to services that provide data upon request. Any of these resources may be of use scientifically, and the Portal
          has simple mechanisms for retrieving them.</p>

          <h3>Images</h3>

          <p>Continuing with the example shown in Fig. 4 (details of a M57 image), clicking the image will bring up a large-scale version of the
          image using the HLA's FITS viewer.</p>

          <h3>Tables</h3>

          <p>Downloading catalogs or tables is somewhat simpler than downloading images, in that any table displayed in the results panel may be
          saved with the following steps:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>click the <b>Export Table As...</b> button</li>

            <li>select the output format and other parameters from the pop-up panel</li>

            <li>click the <b>Export</b> button</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Broadcasting Data via SAMP</h3>

          <p>Many popular applications, including <a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/">TOPCAT</a> and <a href=
          "http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/">DS9</a>, have the ability to broadcast/receive in-memory data to another desktop application that is similarly
          enabled. The Portal can also broadcast a table, via the Simple Application Messaging Protocol (SAMP). The procedure is exactly the same as
          illustrated in Fig. 8 for downloading a table, except that instead of clicking <b>Export</b> as the last step, click the <b>Broadcast</b>
          button. Note that at least one other SAMP-enabled application, such as <a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/">TOPCAT</a> or
          <a href="http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/">Aladin</a> must already be running in order for data to be transferred anywhere. When a table is
          broadcast (in this case, from the Portal to TOPCAT) for the first time during a session a security notification may appear.</p>

          <p>Finally, note that the Portal does not currently support receiving broadcasts of data from other applications.</p>

          <h3>Using a Download Basket</h3>

          <p>For MAST data, the rows of the grid are only a summary of the data products available for download. Select the rows you wish to
          investigate by checking the box on the far left of the row, and add the associated products to the download basket by clicking the orange
          plus sign in the grid. This pops up a window containing the current download basket, which itself is filterable like any other grid. Most
          summaries represent many actual data products, so each product gets its own row in the grid. These can then be then be further selected and
          downloaded using the supplied button.</p>

          <h2><a name="AstroView" id="AstroView"></a>The AstroView Tool</h2>

          <p>The AstroView Tool is an all-sky-viewing component. It was developed as a standalone application, but was later
          afforded a means of interaction with the Portal. It uses the same positional search and name- resolving capabilities as the Portal, but
          instead of displaying tabular results and image files it presents a view of the sky from Earth. This view can be panned, zoomed and
          searched, and the imagery displayed can be changed based on the survey selected using the tool.</p>

          <p>One interaction between the Portal and AstroView is the notion of projecting image "footprints", i.e. the detector shape, size and
          orientation for a given image, onto a background sky map from all-sky survey images. 
          Selected rows in the grid are highlighted in this tool. Clicking footprints or
          markers in AstroView will not only highlight them, but will select them in the grid and bubble them to the top. Selecting is somewhat
          inexact by design - many footprints overlay each other exactly, so many rows may be highlighted in the grid with a single click. Figure 7
          demonstrates footprints and highlighting.</p>

          <p>The AstroView controls listed for each grid contain 3 components:
            <ul>
                <li>Display - A toggle/drop-down menu indicating which footprints are to be displayed</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>None - show no footprints</li>
                    <li>All - show all footprints. Unselected footprints will be the color of the swatch, and selected footprints will appear 
                    slightly highlighted.</li>
                    <li>Selected - show only footprints that are selected in the grid. This acts as a filter for the tool, and can help viewing a 
                    crowded area.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Color - a swatch indicating the color of footprints associated with this search. Each search/grid may have its own color to 
                allow a user to distinguish different grid interactions.</li>
                <li>Palette button - allows user to pick the color for this grid's footprints.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

          <h2><a name="Caveats" id="Caveats"></a>Tips &amp; Notes</h2>

          <p>When <b>formulating a search</b>, note the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Leading zeros are ignored in the name. For example, M5 returns results for object Messier 005.</li>

            <li>Object names are not case-sensitive, and spaces between the characters (e.g. M51 and M 51) are ignored unless the space indicates a
            real character in the name.</li>

            <li>If an object name is incomplete the name resolvers from <a href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu">NED</a> and 
            <a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/">SIMBAD</a> return the closest match. This can lead to surprising results
            however.</li>

            <li>All coordinates are interpreted as J2000.</li>

            <li>Maximum search radius is limited on a collection-by-collection basis.</li>

            <li>Queries are currently limited to a single object or position. However, multiple queries may be submitted sequentially, even if one or
            more queries are still executing.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>When <b>downloading an image</b>, note the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Large images may take a while to download. Download progress can only be monitored using browser tools.</li>

            <li>Downloading is disabled for data products that are embargoed by the provider. It may not be obvious when this happens, except that no
            file will be downloaded to your computer.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>When <b>downloading a table</b>, note the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The <b>Export Table As...</b> operation refers to the currently visible table, and <b>not</b> to a selected row within the
            table.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>When <b>broadcasting a table</b>, note the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>At least one other SAMP-enabled application, such as <a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/">TOPCAT</a> or <a href=
            "http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/">Aladin</a> must already be running in order for data to be sent anywhere.</li>

            <li>The MAST Portal cannot currently receive data sent from other applications.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Tabs of search results are not saved between sessions; once the application has been abandoned, returning to it will not bring up
          previously searched objects.</p>
