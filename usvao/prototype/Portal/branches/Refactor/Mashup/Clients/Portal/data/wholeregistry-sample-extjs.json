  ["#Images#","CLASS","Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey","The Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) is an international collaborative program\n              which has obtained high-resolution radio images of over 10000 flat-spectrum radio\n              sources in order to create the largest and best studied statistical sample of\n              radio-loud gravitationally lensed systems. With this survey, combined with detailed\n              studies of the lenses found therein, constraints can be placed on the expansion rate,\n              matter density, and dark energy (e.g. cosmological constant, quintessence) content of\n              the Universe that are complementary to and independent of those obtained through other\n              methods. CLASS is aimed at identifying lenses where multiple images are formed from\n              compact flat-spectrum radio sources, which should be easily identifiable in the radio\n              maps. Because CLASS is radio-based, dust obscuration in lensing galaxies is not a\n              factor, and the relative insensitivity of the instrument to environmental conditions\n              leads to nearly uniform sensitivity and resolution over the entire survey.","The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO)","##","ivo://nrao.archive/vla/class","2009-03-16T14:29:17Z","#surveys#","#Survey#","",null,"",null,1000000,"","http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~smyers/class.html"],

  ["#Catalog#HTTP Request#Web Page#","INTSCW","INTEGRAL Science Window Data","Because of the pointing-slew-pointing dithering-nature of INTEGRAL operations, each\n              observation of a celestial target is actually comprised of numerous individual S/C\n              pointings and slews. In addition, there are periods within a given sequence where\n              scheduled observations occur, i.e., engineering windows, yet the instruments still\n              acquire data. The INTEGRAL Science Data Center (ISDC) generalizes all of these data\n              acquisition periods into so-called `Science Windows.' A Science Window (ScW) is a\n              continuous time interval during which all data acquired by the INTEGRAL instruments\n              result from a specific S/C attitude orientation state. Pointing (fixed orientation),\n              Slew (changing orientation), and Engineering (undefined orientation) windows are all\n              special cases of a Science Window. The key is that the same attitude information may\n              be associated with all acquired data of a given Science Window. Note that it is\n              possible to divide a time interval that qualifies as a Science Window under this\n              definition into several smaller Science Windows using arbitrary criteria. The INTEGRAL\n              Science Window Data Catalog allows for the keyed search and selection of sets of\n              Science Windows and the retrieval of the corresponding data products.","NASA/GSFC HEASARC","#Gamma-ray#X-ray#","ivo://nasa.heasarc/intscw","2011-05-30T00:00:00","#Observation#","#Archive#","#Research#",10,"",180,99999,"ivo://nasa.heasarc/ASD","http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/integral/intscw.html"],

  ["#Catalog#HTTP Request#Web Page#","XMM/CFRSID","XMM-Newton/Canada-France Redshift Survey Fields Optical Identifications","This table contains the proposed identifications for all the good optical ID\n              candidates (true probability value P' that the object is not associated of\n              &lt; 0.15) corresponding to the X-ray sources from the XMM-Newton surveys of\n              the 3 and 14 hours Right Ascension (hereafter 3-h and 14-h, respectively) fields from\n              the Canada-France Redshift Survey. (These fields are also known as the Groth Strip).\n              The X-ray sources cover the 0.5 - 10 keV flux range from ~2 x 10^-15 - 10^-13\n              erg/cm^2^/s. The authors have used a subset of the XMM-Newton sources, which have\n              Chandra positions, to determine the best method of obtaining optical identifications\n              of sources with only XMM-Newton positions. They found optical identifications for 79%\n              of the XMM-Newton sources for which there were deep optical images. The sources\n              without optical identifications are likely to be optically fainter and have higher\n              redshifts than the sources with identifications. The authors have estimated\n              'photometric redshifts' for the identified sources, calibrating their method using\n              ~200 galaxies in the fields with spectroscopic redshifts. They find that the redshift\n              distribution has a strong peak at z ~ 0.7.","NASA/GSFC HEASARC","#Optical#","ivo://nasa.heasarc/xmmcfrsoid","2008-12-24T00:00:00","#Optical Counterpart#","#Catalog#","#Research#",0.01666667,"",180,99999,"ivo://nasa.heasarc/ASD","http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/xmm-newton/xmmcfrsoid.html"],

The catalog has a companion catalog of high-mass\n              X-ray binaries (HMXBs) which is called HMXBCAT in the HEASARC database system). The\n              catalog contains source name(s), coordinates, X-ray flux, system parameters, and\n              stellar parameters of the components and other characteristic properties of 187\n              low-mass X-ray binaries, together with references to a comprehensive selection of the\n              relevant literature. The aim of this catalog is to provide some basic information on\n              the X-ray sources and their counterparts in other wavelength ranges (gamma-rays, UV,\n              optical, IR, and radio). Some sources, however, are only tentatively identified as\n              low-mass X-ray binaries on the basis of their X-ray properties being similar to the\n              known low-mass X-ray binaries. Further identification in other wavelength bands is\n              needed to finally determine the nature of these sources. In cases where there is some\n              doubt about the low-mass nature of the X-ray binary, this is mentioned. Literature\n              published before 1 October 2006 has, as far as possible, been taken into account.","NASA/GSFC HEASARC","#Optical#X-ray#","ivo://nasa.heasarc/lmxbcat","2008-12-24T00:00:00","#Star#XRB#","#Catalog#","#Research#",0.5,"",180,99999,"ivo://nasa.heasarc/ASD","http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/star-catalog/lmxbcat.html"],

It includes 1143 true and probable planetary nebulae (from Table 1\n              of the publication) and 347 objects whose status was still unclear and were thus\n              classified among the \"possible\" planetary nebulae (from Table 2 of the publication);\n              it does not include 330 objects once considered as possible planetary nebulae but\n              which the authors have since rejected (listed in Table 3 of the publication). The\n              designation system for the planetary nebulae listed in this catalog follows the\n              recommendations of IAU Commission 5 (Astronomical Nomenclature) with the structure:\n              \"PN Glll.l+bb.b\", where PN means \"Planetary Nebula\", G stands for \"Galactic\n              Coordinates\", and lll.l+bb.b are the galactic longitude and latitude respectively,\n              truncated to one decimal place.
