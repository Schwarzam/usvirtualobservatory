<h2>Initiating a Search</h2>
<p>All searches begin
by entering either
the name of an astronomical
object, or the coordinates of a sky position in the <em>search
entry
box</em> in RA/Dec, sexagesimal or
galactic coordinates (on the left in
Fig. 2). The search can be initiated by clicking the <b>Search</b>
button or by pressing the <em>Return</em>
key on your keyboard while
the cursor is in the search entry box.</p>
<table align="center" cellpadding="2" width="500">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="search.png" alt="Search Entry Box" border="0" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Fig. 2&mdash;Search panel
includes the <em>Search</em>
box, radius selector, search button, and
examples of valid search text.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Names of objects are
passed to a name
resolver, which associates
known object names with sky coordinates. A wide variety of catalog and
common names can be resolved to known objects. Coordinates can be given
in a variety of formats; right ascensions must be positive and southern
declinations require a leading negative sign. Examples of valid names
and coordinate formats are given below.</p>

<p>Objects from
standard catalogs such as
Messier and NGC will be
resolved. Common names often work. Further rules and caveats for valid
searches may be found in Tips
&amp; Notes.</p>
<a name="Grid" id="Grid">

<h2>Exploring Search Results</h2>
<p>A successful search,
such as that shown for
M57 in Fig. 3 below,
populates a new <em>Search Results</em>
panel with a table of
resources, a corresponding <em>Filters</em>
panel applicable to these
resources, and focuses the AstroView component on the position.
&nbsp;The results of subsequent searches will be stored in new
tables,
accessed by clicking on the tabs at the top of the Results panel. To
eliminate a results table (and discard the results for that search),
click the "x" icon on the tab. Concurrent searches are possible; if a
new search is initiated prior to the last one completing, a new tab
will be created while the previous search continues. Just below the
tabs is a status panel with the following items from left to right:</p>
<ul>
  <li>coordinates and radius
of
the search</li>
  <li>number of rows retrieved
so
far&nbsp;</li>
  <li>status of searches in
progress, including a button to load newly
available results</li>
  <li>an <b>Export
Table As...</b> button which can
write the table of
results to your local storage.</li>
</ul>
<table cellpadding="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="m57_Results.png" alt="SearchResults" border="0"
 height="534" width="840" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Fig. 3&mdash;Appearance of the
DDT after a search for <b>m57</b>
within <b>radius = .2 degrees</b>,
showing the filters (left panel) that can be applied to the Search
Results (center panel), and the AstroView component. The results of a
prior search/tab may be viewed by clicking the tab (labelled <b>Start
Page</b> in this case) at the top of
the Search Results panel.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p></p>
<h3>Search
Details Pop-Up</h3>
<p>Clicking
on the Info icon
<img alt="" title="Info icon" src="Info.png" height="24" width="24" />&nbsp;in
any search result row
pops up a Details Panel with summary information about the resource;
clicking the double arrows at the bottom of this panel (labelled
"Expand for Details") exposes all of the attributes for the resource.
&nbsp;Additional buttons at the top of the Details Panel present
various options which depend on the type of data described.</p>
<table align="center" cellpadding="2" width="870">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="details_popup.png"
 alt="Resource_PopUp" border="0" height="529" width="602" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Fig. 4&mdash;Summary of an <b>m57</b>
resource, showing the summary description of the resource. Clicking the
double-arrow (circled) at the lower-right of the pop-up brings up all
available details. Different details panel formats exist based on what
is being viewed - resource information, an image, a catalog or spectra.
Sometimes the tool can only provide a generic view of the record.<br />
      </font></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h2>Loading
Data from a
Resource</h2>
<p>Each
row in the inital
search results represents a data resource
that has either image, catalog or spectral data within the search
radius. &nbsp;After applying any desired filters to narrow the
results,
the
data for any resource can be loaded into the DDT by clicking the
Continue to Data &nbsp;<img alt="" title="Continue to Data button"
 src="Load.png" height="24" width="24" /> button for that row.
&nbsp;<br />
The data from that resource will be loaded in a new result tab.
&nbsp;AstroView will render footprints and object positions for
Images
and
Catalog objects respectively.</p>
<a name="Filters" id="Filters">
</a>
<h2>Refining Results
with Filters</h2>
<p>Many searches,
particularly on
popular targets or of a sufficiently
large area of sky, generate sometimes hundreds or even thousands of
rows. The Filters panel allows the user to restrict the list of search
results to those of most interest.</p>
<a name="FilterFacets" id="FilterFacets">
</a>
<h3>Facet
Filters</h3>
<p>The list
of potential
filters is quite large, and includes as many
attributes of the matched data collections as the data providers offer.
The filters in the panel are grouped into semantically related <em>facets</em>
depending on the data. You can view the list of allowed facets by
clicking the <b>Edit Facets</b>
button at the top of the panel; select
the desired facets by clicking the check-boxes in the pop-up window
(middle) and clicking the <b>Apply</b>
button. Note that not all
facets are displayed or even available by default.</p>
<p>There
are three types of
filters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Discrete
filters -
Used for text and most integer-based facets
(columns of data). A filter can be applied by clicking the check-box
next to the desired facet values.</li>
  <li
 style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside; display: inline;">
    <ul>
      <li>A
special discrete
filter can exist when the data rows are
selectable, allowing the user to choose whether to filter selected or
unselected rows.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ranged
sliders - Used for
continuous numeric data, some integer
data, and dates. Each facet presents the user with a histogram
approximating the distribution of the data, a 2 handled slider for
constraining endpoints, and a min/max box displaying the current
endpoints, which also allows a user to manually type the desired
endpoints. Some numeric facets are known to have certain values that
represent a null or undefined entry, and the facet will alert the user
that it is ignoring such a value.</li>
  <li>A search
box, which allows
regular expression matching by
searching all records and columns of the data (even ones not visible in
the display grid).</li>
</ul>
<table align="center" cellpadding="2" width="700">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="filtered_search_zoom.png"
 alt="filtered search" height="686" width="652" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3"><font size="-1">Fig. 5&mdash; The search has been
filtered by constraining the RA bounds. For example, only 76 of the
rows where "ex" is 0 remain in the grid. Regular expressions may also
be used as filters by entering a regular expression (usually just a
word) in the dialog box near the top of the panel. In the numeric facet
above, the data was recognized as RA coordinates and is presented in
these boxes in sexagesimal format, but a user may define his or her own
bounds using sexagesimal or degrees. Pressing the "Zoom to Range"
button spreads the histogram out to cover only the originally selected
range.</font></td>

<h2>Retrieving
Results</h2>
<p>A core
capability of the DDT is
to enable users to download
resources, or to direct them to other desktop applications for
analysis. As used here, <em>resources</em>
is a rather generic term
used to refer to individual data files (images, tables, and the like),
or collections of them, or to services that provide data upon request.
Any of these resources may be of use scientifically, and the DDT has
simple mechanisms for retrieving them.</p>
<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>Downloading
catalogs or tables is
somewhat simpler than downloading
images, in that any table displayed in the results panel may be saved
with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Click the <b>Export</b>
button&nbsp;<img alt="" title="Export button" src="Export.png"
 height="24" width="24" /> at
the top right of the table display.</li>
    <li>Select the
output format
and other parameters from the pop-up
panel</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Export</b>
button</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<h3>Images and
Spectra</h3>
<p>For Image and
Spectral results,
click the Info icon <img alt="" title="Info icon" src="Info.png"
 height="24" width="24" />&nbsp;in a
result row, the click the Download File icon <img alt=""
 title="Download icon" src="Save.png" height="24" width="24" />&nbsp;in
the details panel to retrieve the data file. &nbsp;The file can
also be
broadcast to other desktop applications by clicking on the Broadcast
icon <img alt="" title="Broadcast icon" src="Broadcast.png" height="24"
 width="24" />&nbsp;(see next section for more
information on
broadcasting, and how to broadcast table data).<br />
</p>
<h3>Broadcasting
Data via SAMP</h3>
<p>Many popular
applications,
including <a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/%7Embt/topcat/">TOPCAT</a>,
<a href="http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/">Aladin</a>,
and <a href="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/">DS9</a>,
have the ability to
receive data from another similarly enabled desktop application . The
DDT can broadcast a table, via the Simple Application Messaging
Protocol (<a href="http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/SAMP/">SAMP</a>).
The
procedure is the same as downloading a table, except that instead of
clicking <b>Export</b>
as the last step, click the <b>Broadcast</b>
button. Note that at least one other SAMP-enabled application, such as <a
 href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/%7Embt/topcat/">TOPCAT</a>
or <a href="http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/">Aladin</a>
must already be running
in order for data to be transferred anywhere. When a table is broadcast
(in this case, from the DDT to TOPCAT) for the first time during a
session a security notification may appear.</p>
<p>Finally, note that the DDT does
not currently support receiving
broadcasts of data from other applications.</p>

<h2><a name="AstroView" id="AstroView">The AstroView
Tool</a></h2>
<p><a name="AstroView" id="AstroView">The AstroView
Tool is an
all-sky-viewing component which uses the
same positional search and name- resolving capabilities as the DDT, but
instead of displaying tabular results and image files it presents a
view of the sky from Earth. This view can be panned, zoomed and
searched, and the imagery displayed can be changed based on the survey
selected using the tool.</a></p>
<p><a name="AstroView" id="AstroView">One
interaction between the DDT
and AstroView is the notion of
projecting image "footprints", i.e. the detector shape, size and
orientation for a given image, onto the survey images. Selected rows in
the grid are highlighted in this tool. Clicking footprints or markers
in AstroView will not only highlight them, but will select them in the
grid and bubble them to the top. Selecting is somewhat inexact by
design - many footprints overlay each other exactly, so many rows may
be highlighted in the grid with a single click. Figure 6 demonstrates
footprints and highlighting.</a></p>
<p><a name="AstroView" id="AstroView">The AstroView
controls listed for
each grid contain 3 components
(circled in Fig. 6 below): </a></p>
<ul>
  <a name="AstroView" id="AstroView"> <li>Display - A
toggle
indicating which footprints are to be displayed</li>
  </a>
  <ul>
    <a name="AstroView" id="AstroView"> <li>None - show no
footprints</li>
    <li>All - show all
footprints.
Unselected footprints will be the
color of the swatch, and selected footprints will appear slightly
highlighted.</li>
    <li>Selected -
show only
footprints that are selected in the grid.
This acts as a filter for the tool, and can help viewing a crowded area.</li>
    </a>
  </ul>
  <a name="AstroView" id="AstroView"> <li>Color - a
swatch indicating
the color of footprints associated
with this search. Each search result is automatically assigned a new
color to help distinguish its graphics from those of the previous
searches. &nbsp;Clicking on the palette icon allows the user to
select
a new color for this search.</li>

to pick the color for this grid's

<h2>Tips &amp;
Notes</h2>
<p>When <b>formulating
a search</b>,
note the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leading zeros are
ignored in
the
name. For example, M5 returns
results for object Messier 005.</li>
  <li>Object names are
not
case-sensitive, and spaces between the
characters (e.g. M51 and M 51) are ignored unless the space indicates a
real character in the name.</li>
  <li>If an object name
is
incomplete the name resolvers from NED and
SIMBAD return the closest match. This can lead to surprising results
however.</li>
  <li>All coordinates
are
interpreted as J2000.</li>
  <li>Maximum search
radius is
limited on a collection-by-collection
basis.</li>
  <li>Queries are
currently
limited to a single object or position.
However, multiple queries may be submitted sequentially, even if one or
more queries are still executing.</li>
</ul>
<p>When <b>downloading
an image</b>,
note the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Large images may
take a
while to
download. Progress can be
monitored using browser tools.</li>
  <li>Downloading is
disabled for
data products that are embargoed by
the provider. It may not be obvious when this happens, except that no
file will be downloaded to your computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>When <b>downloading
a table</b>,
note the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Export
button&nbsp;<img alt="" title="Export button" src="Export.png"
 height="24" width="24" /></b>
refers to the currently
visible table, and <b>not</b>
to a selected row within the table.</li>
</ul>
<p>When <b>broadcasting
a table</b>,
note the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At least one other
SAMP-enabled
application, such as </li>
  <a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/%7Embt/topcat/">TOPCAT</a>
or <a href="http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/">Aladin</a>
must already be
running
in order for data to be sent anywhere. <li>The
DDT cannot currently
receive data sent from other
applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tabs of search results are not
saved between sessions; once the
application has been abandoned, returning to it will not bring up
previously searched objects.</p>
