      <p> The MAST Portal is a web application for searching repositories of information about Astronomical Data, Publications and Images.</p>
          <p>(Note: Throughout this user's guide there are screenshots taken from a development environment that may include features or
          data states that are not normally reachable by users. They are only meant to serve as visual guides.)</p>

      <h2> <a name="Search" id="Search"></a> Initiating a Search </h2>

      <p> All searches begin by choosing a collection and entering either the name of an astronomical object, or the coordinates of a sky position in the <em>search entry box</em> (on the left in Fig. 2). 
        A radius can be appended to the search by add "r=" and a radius, with units of "d", "m" or "s". Some collections have search radius limitations, and the default radius is usually .2 degrees. The search can be initiated by 
        clicking the <b>Search</b> button or by pressing the <em>Return</em> key on your keyboard while the cursor is in the search entry box. </p>
      <table cellpadding="2" width="500">

      <p> Names of objects are passed to a name resolver (one of many Virtual Observatory services 
        that support the Portal), which associates known object names with sky 
        coordinates. A wide variety of catalog and common names can be resolved 
        to known objects. Coordinates can be given in a variety of formats; 
        right ascensions must be positive and southern declinations require a 
        leading negative sign. Examples of valid names and coordinate formats 
        are given below. </p>

      <h2> <a name="Grid" id="Grid"></a>Exploring Search Results </h2>

      <p> A successful search, such as that shown for M57 below, populates a new <em>Search Results</em>
        panel with a table of resources and a corresponding <em>Filters</em> panel applicable to these resources. The results of 
        subsequent searches will be stored in new tables, and can be accessed by
        clicking on the tabs at the top of the Results panel. To eliminate a 
        results table (and discard the results for that search), click the &quot;x&quot; 
        icon on the tab. Concurrent searches are possible; if a new search is 
        initiated prior to the last one completing, a new tab will be created 
        while the previous search continues. Just below the tabs is a status 
        panel with the following items from left to right: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the number of rows retrieved (and update information for searches in progress)</li>
        <li>an <b>Export Table As...</b> button which can write the table of results to your local storage</li>
        <li>the object name and coordinates from the name resolver</li>
        <li>the search radius</li>
      </ul>
      <table cellpadding="2" width="820">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="../../../Shared/help/m57_Results.png" alt="SearchResults" border="0"/></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Fig. 3&#8212;Appearance of the Portal after a search for <b>m57</b> within <b>radius = .2 degrees</b>,
              showing the filters (left panel) that can be applied to the Search 
              Results (center panel). The results of a prior search may be viewed by 
              clicking the tab (labelled <b>HST Press Releases: m57</b> in this case) at the top of the Search Results panel. </font></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p> The records are listed in the table, one per row. Each record represents data about a particular image or object, with the columns
      defining each datum about the record. In the example above, each displayed record is about a WFC2 image that was found within the
      bounds of the search.</p>

      <h3><a name="ResultDetails" id="ResultDetails"></a>Search Details Pop-Up</h3>

      <p> Clicking on any row in the Search Results panel pops up a panel with
        summary information about the resource; clicking the double arrows at 
        the bottom of this panel (labelled &quot;Expand for Details&quot;) exposes all of 
        the attributes for the resource. </p>
      <table cellpadding="2" width="870">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="../../../Shared/help/details_popup.png" alt="Resource_PopUp" border="0" /></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td colspan="2"><font size="-1">Fig. 4&#8212;Summary of a <b>m57</b> image,
              showing the summary description of the resource (left). Clicking the 
              double-arrow at the lower-right of the pop-up brings up all available details, as shown at right.
              Different details panel formats exist for the various collections - for collections where the tool knows, 
              for example, that there will be an image and a URL that links to a large-format version, it will pop up a
              details panel such as this one that links to it. Other image records may be displayed differently, and
              sometimes the format is so hard to determine that the tool can only provide a generic view of the data.</font></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2><a name="Filters" id="Filters"></a>Refining Results with Filters</h2>

      <p> Many searches, particularly on popular targets or of a sufficiently 
        large area of sky, generate sometimes hundreds or even thousands of 
        rows. The Filters panel allows the user to restrict the list of services
        to those of most interest. A filter can be applied by clicking the 
        check-box next to the filter type. </p>

      <h3><a name="FilterFacets" id="FilterFacets"></a>Filter Facets</h3>

      <p> The list of potential filters is quite large, and includes as many 
        attributes of the matched data collections as the data providers offer. 
        The filters in the panel are grouped into semantically related <em>facets</em> depending on the data. You can view the list of allowed facets by clicking the <b>Edit Filters</b> button at the top of the panel; select the desired facets by clicking 
        the check-boxes in the pop-up window (middle) and clicking the <b>Apply</b> button. Note that not all facets are displayed or even available by default. </p>
      <table cellpadding="2" width="700">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="../../../Shared/help/filtered_search.png" alt="Filtered Search" align="middle" border="0"/></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td colspan="3"><font size="-1">Fig. 5&#8212; The search has been filtered for rows where the Target Name is "NGC6720E".
            This updates the counts of the other facet values based on how many other rows can be selected. For example, 18 of the original
            77 rows where the Instrument was WFPC2/WFPC2 intersect with the currently applied filters, and two of the PI fields are grayed
            out because they cannot possibly intersect with the current selection. Note: NGC6720 is not grayed out because values within
            a particular facet are joined as a union, i.e. where Target Name is NGC6720 or NGC6720E.<p />
            The filters that are visible in the panel may be changed by clicking the <b>Edit Filters</b> button at the top and checking the filters of interest in the pop-up window (<em>middle</em>).
            Regular expressions may also be used as filters by entering a regular expression in the dialog box near the top of the panel.</font></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2><a name="Download" id="Download"></a> Retrieving Results</h2>

      <p> A core capability of the MAST Portal is to enable users to 
        download resources, or to direct them to other desktop applications for 
        analysis. As used here, <em>resources</em> is a rather generic term used
        to refer to individual data files (images, tables, and the like), or 
        collections of them, or to services that provide data upon request. Any 
        of these resources may be of use scientifically, and the Portal has simple 
        mechanisms for retrieving them. </p>

      <h3>Images</h3>

      <p> Continuing with the example shown in Fig. 4 (details of a M57 image), clicking the
          image will bring up a large-scale version of the image using the HLA's FITS viewer. </p>

      <h3>Tables</h3>

      <p> Downloading catalogs or tables is somewhat simpler than downloading images, in 
        that any table displayed in the results panel may be saved with the 
        following steps: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>click the <b>Export Table As...</b> button</li>
        <li>select the output format and other parameters from the pop-up panel</li>
        <li>click the <b>Export</b> button</li>
      </ol>
      <p> This procedure applies to search results as well. The operation may be aborted by clicking the <b>Cancel</b> button or dismissing the pop-up panel by clicking the &quot;x&quot; icon. Figure 8
        illustrates these steps for sources extracted from the NOMAD catalog 
        that lie within 1 arcmin of M57. This search continues the example from,
        Fig. 3: the NOMAD resource (row 18 of the original search) was loaded 
        into a new tab, labelled &quot;M57 r=1m: NOMAD&quot;. </p>

      <h3>Broadcasting Data via SAMP</h3>

      <p> Many popular applications, including <a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/">TOPCAT</a> 
        and <a href="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/">DS9</a>, have the ability to
        broadcast in-memory data to another desktop application that is 
        similarly enabled. The Portal can also broadcast a table, via the Simple 
        Application Messaging Protocol (SAMP). The procedure is exactly the same
        as illustrated in Fig. 8 for downloading a table, except that instead 
        of clicking <b>Export</b> as the last step, click the <b>Broadcast</b> button. 
        Note that at least one other SAMP-enabled application, such as <a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/">TOPCAT</a> or <a href="http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/">Aladin</a> must 
        already be running in order for data to be transferred anywhere. When a 
        table is broadcast (in this case, from the Portal to TOPCAT) for the first 
        time during a session a security notification may appear.</p>

      <p> Finally, note that the Portal does not currently support receiving broadcasts of data from other applications. </p>

      <h2><a name="AstroView" id="AstroView"></a>The AstroView Tool</h2>

      <p> The AstroView Tool is an all-sky-viewing component developed in Flash. It was developed as a standalone application, but was
          later afforded a means of interaction with the Portal. It uses the same positional search and name-
          resolving capabilities as the Portal, but instead of displaying tabular results and image files it presents a view of the sky from Earth.
          This view can be panned, zoomed and searched, and the imagery displayed can be changed based on the survey selected using the tool.</p>
      <p> One interaction between the Portal and AstroView is the notion of projecting image "footprints", i.e. the detector shape, size and orientation
          for a given image, onto the survey images. Figure 6 demonstrates this.
      </p>
      <table cellpadding="2" width="700">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="../../../Shared/help/astroview.png" alt="Filtered Search" align="middle" border="0"/></td>

      <h2><a name="Caveats" id="Caveats"></a>Tips &amp; Notes</h2>

      <p> When <b>formulating a search</b>, note the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leading zeros are ignored in the name. For example, M5 returns results for object Messier 005. </li>
        <li>Object names are not case-sensitive, and spaces between the 
          characters (e.g. M51 and M 51) are ignored unless the space indicates a 
          real character in the name. </li>
        <li>If an object name is incomplete the name resolvers from NED and 
          SIMBAD return the closest match. This can lead to surprising results 
          however. </li>
        <li> All coordinates are interpreted as J2000.</li>
        <li>Maximum search radius is limited on a collection-by-collection basis.</li>
        <li>Queries are currently limited to a single object or position. However, 
          multiple queries may be submitted sequentially, even if one or more 
          queries are still executing. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> When <b>downloading an image</b>, note the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Large images may take a while to download. Download progress can only be monitored using browser tools.</li>
        <li> Downloading is disabled for data products that are embargoed by
          the provider. It may not be obvious when this happens, except that no 
          file will be downloaded to your computer. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> When <b>downloading a table</b>, note the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The <b>Export Table As...</b> operation refers to the currently visible table, and <b>not</b> to a selected row within the table.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> When <b>broadcasting a table</b>, note the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>At least one other SAMP-enabled application, such as 
            <a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/">TOPCAT</a> or 
            <a href="http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/">Aladin</a> must 
        already be running in order for data to be sent anywhere.</li>
        <li>The MAST Portal cannot currently receive data sent from other applications.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Tabs of search results are not saved between sessions; once the 
        application has been abandoned, returning to it will not bring up 
        previously searched objects. </p>
