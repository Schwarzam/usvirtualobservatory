Pubcookie is growing long in the tooth; to build in current Linux
distributions (such as CentOS 5), use/modify these scripts.

Take a look at them first; they are very simple and mostly just
specify an extra variable or two.

If you are building on a 32-bit platform, you will need to modify
make.sh to point to /usr/lib instead of /usr/lib64.

  * configure-app-server.sh   -- configure mod_pubcookie
                                 (optional ./configure should also work)
  * configure-login-server.sh -- configure to build login server
  * make.sh                   -- make (with extra parameters)
  * sudo make.sh install      -- make install (with extra parameters)
