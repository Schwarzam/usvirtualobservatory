Hello @fullname@,

You have completed your NVO logon registration.  

Your NVO identity is @username@.  It is a single, unique identity
which you can use with any VO-compliant portal to gain access to
proprietary data and enhanced services such as remote storage.

To protect your identity, be careful to only enter your NVO password
into the NVO Login Page at:

    https://sso.us-vo.org

You can change your password or request a password reminder at
https://sso.us-vo.org/register/password.jsp.

Now that you have registered, the NVO can supply you and NVO-compliant
portals that you visit with a "standard" security credential, which
has been verified by this email exchange.  For more information, visit
the NVO Identity Portal, http://nvologin1.ncsa.uiuc.edu.

If you have any questions or problems, please contact us at
ysvenkat@ncsa.illinois.edu
