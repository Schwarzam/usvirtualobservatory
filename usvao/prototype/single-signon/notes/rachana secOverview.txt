GT Security Overview

- HTTPS
        - CoG library 
                - http://www-unix.globus.org/cog/java/
                - cog-jglobus.jar
        - server side (GSIServiceThread.java)
        - cog-axis.jar
                - client side (HTTPS Sender)
- Overall security

    = Handlers 
    = Server side steps:
      * Request
                Authentication
                Security policy enforcement
                authorization
        
        - Authentication
                - WSSecurityHandler (WSRequestEngine)
                        - Identitfy different methods
                        - extract from SOAP Message (Apache WSS4J)  
                        - certificate validation (CoG)
                        - signature/encryption (Apache XML security)
                - add credenials to Subject associated with thread
                - AuthenticationServiceHandler
        - Security policy enforcement
                - SecurityPolicyHandler(DescriptorHandler)
                        - based on properties set in authentication step
                          and requirements set by service owner
                - RunAsHandler
                        - based on configuration by service owner
        -  Authorization
                - only if authentication was done
                - Chain of authorization methods
                        - deny override
      * Response
                - same security mechanism as request is used
                - X509(Sign/Encrypt)Handler, GSSHandler
                - WSSecurityResponseEngine
                - To construct and embed SOAP header - Apache WSS4J
                - To sign/encrypt - Apache XML Security
    = Client side steps
        - configuration is in stubs
       * Request
                - X509(Sign/Encrypt)Handler, 
                - SecContextHandler
                - Authentication
                        - sign/encrypt message
                        - HTTPSSender for transport security
       * Response
                - WSSecurityClientHandler
                        - Ensure server response secure (same as request)
                        - authorization
        

GSISecureConversation:
        - Redirect to AuthenticationService
        - Negotiate context
        - Redirect back to service
