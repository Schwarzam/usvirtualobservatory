Wednesday 9 am -- BI 4169

To Do: investigate GAMA (using MyProxy and CAS on back-end)
To Do: investigate Kepler (we had thought to use OGCE framework)

If we use MyProxy without GAMA, that's not incompatible if GAMA is used later

Protect scientists, their data, and their models, which they feel protective of

Metacat -- has its own API -- served by a Servlet
  - internally talks to LDAP

EcoGrid Query
  - want to figure out how to manage state
      - used to use web session
      - now use (proxy) credentials?

Goals for these six months (Mark)
  - Single signon
  - Search via Metacat
  - Select one or two datasets to apply a particular analysis
  - Analysis run at a different site
      - therefore, data has to be available to that site
  - Visualization sent back to user at another site
  - Audit trails for data owners

But:
  - Unless the analysis is run on HPC, what benefit is this to
    scientists?
      - no help from single signon when you're only signing in to a
        single place anyway
      - as a pilot, it's unlikely to show great capacity right away,
        which may not be very exciting to scientists
      - most of this stuff, if it works, you don't see it -- need to
        make sure the complexity is explained
      - audit trail events can be used, for example, to let scientists
        know when their data is accessed, and by whom

Security Notes:

  - Plan to modify MetaCat to use certificates (GSI) instead of just
    username/password everywhere

  - Note that the LDAP system is distributed

      1. Check central server, which returns a referral
      2. Go to remote server for actual authentication

      - But when a remote server is down, the timeouts bring the
        system to its knees
      - Using OpenLDAP
      - Looking into replication in addition to referrals

Concrete: (* SRD will do)

  - Portal: GridSphere
      - already uses MyProxy
      - drop in proxy mgmt portlets (OGCE)
  * MyProxy LDAP/PAM
      * new development by SRD
      - would be nice to deploy the server to an LTER community
        machine (long-term)
      * in the meantime, provide access to the test server
      * need to get our own test accounts in LTER LDAP and get client
        access to the servers
  * Securing MetaCat with GSSI
  * Audit logging & Event Service
      * still need to capture requirements
      - may not be solvable, since there's not always a feedback loop
        from the end-user back to the originator
      - owner of data wants to know who is accessing data and why
          - track the LDAP identity
      * if getting full data from MetaCat, you can log it
      - however, when EML has only metadata (no data), the sites each
        have their own mechanisms, some of which don't have a useful
        audit log
      - maybe we can do it on our POP (point of presence) from the
        LTER site (that is, if we use POPs at all ...)
      - then we need to transform it into a notification that's
        appropriate for the site (but we may just accumulate a list of
        file accesses)
      - watch out for backing ourselves into a corner and unable to
        audit
