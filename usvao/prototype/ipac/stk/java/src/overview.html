<h2>Spatial Tool Kit</h2>
<p>
    This toolkit is aimed at performing various kinds of spatial operations
    on very large datasets by leveraging the
    <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/">Hadoop Map/Reduce framework</a>
    for distributed computation - see
    <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html">
      Google's original Map/Reduce paper</a>
    for background information on this paradigm. The toolkit currently deals
    <strong>only</strong> with spatial data on the unit sphere.
