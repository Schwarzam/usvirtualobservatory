1. DOWNLOADING MONTAGE

The latest version of the Montage code can be found at:

    http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/download.html

Montage can be downloaded as a gzipped tar file (Montage_vX.Y.tar.gz), or
as individual components.  


2. INSTALLING MONTAGE

  i.   Unpack the gzipped tar file:

         gunzip Montage_vX.Y.tar.gz
         tar xvf Montage_vX.Y.tar
     
     This will create the directory Montage_vX.Y, which contains all the 
     necessary files to build Montage.    

  ii.  Go into the Montage directory:

          cd Montage_vX.Y  (though presumably if you are reading
			    this file you are already in the 
			    right directory)

  iii. Type the following:

          make

       This will configure and build Montage on your system.
