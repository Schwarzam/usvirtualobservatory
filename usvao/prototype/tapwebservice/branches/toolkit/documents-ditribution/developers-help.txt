TAP service :


This document is "optional" for developers who want to explore this package more.


ADQL Parser and spatial constraints:

This Toolkit uses Astrogrid ADQL parser to parse adql query targetted to different kinds of databases.
This tap service does not support the spatial/positional queries through adql as it depends on the databases one wants to serve by this service. But it has a provision to make some updates in the code accordingly.

In the code under "edu.jhu.pha.helpers" there is adqlhelper package and QueryHelper.java is used to us this package to parse the queries. If you want to make changes in the existing ADQL parser  you need to change the stylesheet for particular database. All stylesheets are "edu.jhu.pha.helpers.adqlhelper.styles". For this you need to have sound knowledge of ".xsl" stylesheets techniques. 

SQL script and parsing:
In addition to above one can look into securing your database server from server side itself by adding some stored procedure which can take care of all input queries to avoid malicious attempts.


There are two features (still in beta level) implemented in the sevice 

1. Authentication Package
2. VOSpace connectivity

If you want to implement both these features , you will need to make sure to do some changes in the properties file
depending on your requirement. Authentication package "oauth" is used here in this toolkit.
This authentication works with US VAO single sign on service, so if you dont want to develope your own authentication service. You have to use the US-VAO service and set your tap service accordingly.

VOSpace interface is an experimental code added in this tap service, but to make it work
first authentication needs to be implemented properly. In this case both tapservice and vospace share
same authentication service.
