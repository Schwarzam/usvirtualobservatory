Simple Spectral Access (SSA) Generic Service Implementation
---------------------------------------------------------

This SSA implementation uses a Spectrum table to describe the data
collection to be provided by an SSA service instance.  Both the SSA V1
and V2-proto versions of the protocol are simultaneously supported.
Details of the data model for each SSA version are provided by the
SsapKeywordFactory class.  A service implementation may optionally be
configured to use tasking (see the TaskManager class) to compute
on-demand virtual data products.
