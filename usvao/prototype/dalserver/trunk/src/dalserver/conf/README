CONF -- Tools for importing data collections, extracting standard
metadata, and building DBMS tables to drive data service instances.
This package is also used by the SLA package to populate the keyword
factory for a spectral line list from an XML descriptor.

TODO - The XML extensions to KeywordFactory used by SLA should probably
be merged into the DALServer core.  "Conf" can then be renamed as
"Import" or some such, and dedicated to tools for importing data
collections.
