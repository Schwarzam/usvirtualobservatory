DALServer-based Data Services
----------------------------------

This package contains several working data services, intended mainly to
demonstrate how to use DALServer to implement a VO data service.

    JhuSsapService.java		Reference SSAP for JHU spectrum services(*)
    JhuSsapServlet.java
    JhuProxyService.java	Old version of DALServer JHU proxy service
    JhuProxyServlet.java

To implement your own service, simply add modified versions of the
"*Service.java" and "*Servlet.java" files for the appropriate service
class (SCS, SSAP, SIAP, etc.), and modify web/WEB-INF/web.xml to
add the new service plus set any runtime configuration parameters.

Typing "ant" at the root directory will recompile the whole
package including your new service.  Typing "ant dist" will build a
distribution in the "dist" subdirectory.  This builds a War file in
dist containing the servlet, which one can deploy in a Java application
server in various ways, e.g., by running the manager code in the
Tomcat server.

(*) Note that JHU now has their own native SSAP service for the
Sloan spectra.  This version is a proxy to provide a reference
SSA service within the DALServer framework (the service interface,
VOTable formatting etc. are all done with DALServer, but the actual
data and metadata comes from JHU/SDSS).
