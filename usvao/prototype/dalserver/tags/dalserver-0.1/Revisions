----------------------------

Revisions +
	Added this revisions file to the DALServer root.  (DCT 25Jun07)

src/dalserver/SsapServlet.java
	Changed version to 0.1.1.  (DCT 27Jun07)

src/dalserver/RequestResponse.java
	Changed the query response format MIME type returned for a
	votable to "application/x-votable+xml" (the previous value of
	"text/xml;x-votable" was incorrect for the query response
	MIME type).  (DCT 27Jun07)

src/demo/JhuSsapService.java
src/dalserver/SsapServlet.java
	1. Added support to the JHU SSA proxy service to support GIF as an
	output graphics format.  This includes a provision to pass-through
	to the remote JHU service any client-specific parameters, e.g.,
	"width=220&height=200&title=no".
	2. Add the parameter pass-through feature for the "native" spectral
	format as well, since this is entirely generated by the remote
	service.  (DCT 27Jun07)

src/dalserver/SsapServlet.java
	Changed the parameter level of ServiceEngine to "extension".
	A bug was causing this to be "client", which was incorrect, plus
	it would interfere with pass-through of client specified params.
	(DCT 27Jun07)

web/index.html
	Added "graphic" as an output format for the JHU proxy SSA service
	in the main query form.  Added a revision number and date to the
	main query page.  (28Jun07)
