Simple Image Access (SIA) Generic Service Implementation
---------------------------------------------------------

This SIA implementation uses an Image table to describe the data
collection to be provided by an SIA service instance.  Both the SIA V1
and V2-proto versions of the protocol are simultaneously supported.
Details of the data model for each SIA version are provided by the
SiapKeywordFactory class.  A service implementation may optionally be
configured to use tasking (see the TaskManager class) to compute
on-demand virtual data products.
