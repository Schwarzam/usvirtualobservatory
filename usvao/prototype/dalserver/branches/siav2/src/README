DALServer Sources
-------------------

dalserver
	The DALServer classes.

dataServices
	Demo code for custom services, in particular the Jhu proxy SSAP
	service.   This is an actual working service which provides a
	nontrivial example of how to construct a SSAP data service using
	DALServer.

tasks
	Source code for computational tasks, typically used to build
	data products as part of the "back-end" processing system.  Most
	back-end or cluster processing is custom, but DALServer includes
	some generic processing capability via these tasks.  Compute
	tasks may be implemented in any language and are not part of the
	Java servlet per-se, but are rather run from the servlet as a
	component of back-end processing.
