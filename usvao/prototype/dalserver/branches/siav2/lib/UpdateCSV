# Update CSV content of data models
# ------------------------------------
#
# These data models are maintained in spreadsheet form, and saved to CSV
# for inclusion in the DALServer build runtimes.  Once the CSV files are
# updated in LIB, run one of the following commands at the root directory
# to convert each CSV to a Java module:
#
# Compile CSV to Java (TODO: add this to the main build.xml to automate
# the update):
#
#    java dalserver.sia.SiapKeywordFactory
#    java dalserver.ssa.SsapKeywordFactory
#
# A normal Ant build will then pick up the new keyword factories, one per
# version of each data model (this assumes that the user environment has
# been set up as needed for a DALServer build, setting the classpath and
# so on).
