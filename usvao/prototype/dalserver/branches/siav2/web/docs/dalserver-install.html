<h1 style="color: black;">DALServer Installation Overview<br>
</h1><p>The DALServer framework contains everything required to expose
astronomical data (astronomical catalogs, image or spectral data
collections with associated metadata, or spectral line lists) via the
standard VO
protocols.&nbsp; Installation is straightforward: deploy the prebuilt
Java Web application and configure your local data services, computing
standard VO metadata for a data collection where required.&nbsp; A
single installation can support any number of data services, each
associated with a specific catalog or logical data collection.&nbsp; No
software development is required, although extension of the framework
is possible to provide more advanced functionality.<br>
</p>



<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
A host machine with a Java applications server or servlet container
already installed is assumed, as well as a database management system
(DBMS) to contain astronomical catalogs to be exposed, or metadata tables describing
the data collections to be
published.&nbsp; For our examples here we assume that the applications
server is Apache Tomcat, installed on the local host in the default
configuration.&nbsp; Other
application servers or configurations are possible but are not
described here.<br>

<h2>Installation</h2>


The precompiled DALServer Web-app is installed as follows:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Download the <a href="http://vaosa-vm1.aoc.nrao.edu/vo/dalserver/dalserver.tgz">DALServer installation
tarball</a> from this page.</li>
  <li>Unpack the tarball (unpacking to <span style="font-family: monospace;">/opt/services/dalserver</span> will
simplify the installation).</li>
  <li>Deploy the prebuilt DALServer Web-app <span style="font-family: monospace;">ivoa-dal.war</span> to the
applications server (e.g., Tomcat).</li>
  <li>Wait a few seconds, then bring up <a href="http://localhost:8080/ivoa-dal">http://localhost:8080/ivoa-dal </a>in
a Web browser (a different URL may be required depending upon how the applications server was installed).</li>
</ul>The browser should then display the DALServer administration
console.&nbsp; At this point this is just a static Web page providing
query interfaces for the service instances that are built into
DALServer.&nbsp; These should be exercised to verify that installation
was successful and the service code is functioning correctly.&nbsp; The
services currently provided as built-ins are a cone search service for
an integrated copy of the Messier catalog, and null query (metadata
only) services for SIA and SSA.&nbsp; Although the data provided built into the framework is
minimal, these are real services that
exercise the same configuration mechanism and generic service code that
will be used later for actual local data services.<br>

<h2>Configuration</h2>


<p>Service configuration is performed by preparing one or two service
configuration text files per service, typically by copying and
modifying an
existing configuration or a template file, and then reloading the
modified configuration.&nbsp; The <a href="dalserver-config.html">Service Configuration</a> page provides detailed instructions for service configuration, but we summarize the overall procedure here.<br>
</p>

<p>
Local configuration data is stored externally to the DALServer Webapp (<span style="font-family: monospace;">ivoa-dal.war</span>)
to ensure that it is not lost when a new version of the Webapp is
installed. By default local configuration data is stored in the
directory "<span style="font-family: monospace;">/opt/services/dalserver</span>"
on the server running the Java application server (refer to the
detailed documentation if you need to use a
different directory). If you unpacked the DALServer tarball into this
directory earlier, you will already have sample and template
configuration files available in this directory, ready to be used to
configure new services.</p>

<p>
Every service instance requires a service (servlet) configuration "<span style="font-family: monospace;">.conf</span>" file. Each service may
optionally have a table configuration ("<span style="font-family: monospace;">.tab</span>")
file as well, used to customize the metadata to be returned by the
service as well as the interface to the DBMS table used to drive the
service.
A global "<span style="font-family: monospace;">server.conf</span>"
file defines the global DALServer configuration and points to the
locally added data services.</p>

<p>
An example of a local service configuration directory follows:</p>

<div style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);">
<pre>    README               server.conf             siapv2-vlafirst.conf<br>    reload.conf          siap-null.conf          siapv2-vlafirst.tab<br>    scs-messier.conf     siapv1-vlafirst.conf    slap-null.conf<br>    scs-vlafirst.conf    siapv1-vlafirst.tab     ssap-null.conf<br>    scsVaoImage.conf     siapv2-vao.conf<br>    scsVaoImage.tab      siapv2-vao.tab<br></pre>
</div>

<p>
For example, if we wanted to configure a new cone search service for
the Abell
catalog, we would add a new service configuration file, e.g., "<span style="font-family: monospace;">scs-abell.conf</span>", optionally a
table configuration file as well ("<span style="font-family: monospace;">scs-abell.tab</span>"),
and add a line to server.conf telling it to create a service instance
for the new cone search service. </p>

<p>
Once the service configuration has been edited, the DALServer "reload"
resource is used to reload the local configuration, affecting all
service
instances).&nbsp; A reload should be performed whenever the
configuration changes or
whenever a new version of the DALServer Webapp is installed.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>

<p>For example, to execute a reload for an application server running
on port 8080 on the localhost, visit the following URL:<br>
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://localhost:8080/ivoa-dal/reload">
http://localhost:8080/ivoa-dal/reload</a></div>

<p>Note the application server must have read permission on the
configuration directory for this to work.&nbsp; If
"reload" executes successfully it prints a summary of the new service
configuration, e.g.: </p>

<div style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);">
<pre>    WebApp: DALServer Framework Test Configuration<br><br>    reload		0 parameters<br>    scs-messier		12 parameters<br>    siap-null		3 parameters<br>    ssap-null		3 parameters<br>    scsVaoImage		14 parameters tableconfig<br>    scs-vlafirst	13 parameters<br>    siapv2-vlafirst	18 parameters tableconfig<br>    siapv1-vlafirst	18 parameters tableconfig<br>    siapv2-vao		20 parameters tableconfig<br><br>    Successfully created 9 servlets<br>    2014/08/21 15:12:16<br></pre>
</div>

<p>After a reload it is advisable to wait a few seconds for the
application server to reload the modified configuration.&nbsp; A simple
password protection mechanism is available to protect against
unauthorized configuration reloads, which should be enabled in a
production system.<br>
</p>



<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>Java programming is not required to use
DALServer, but may be needed to customize the functionality for
advanced services.&nbsp; DALServer is a Java Webapp; it is
self-contained and uses Ant as the
build tool.&nbsp; The details of how DALServer works internally and can
be extended are beyond the scope of what we can cover here, however the
<a href="http://localhost:8080/ivoa-dal/javadoc/">DALServer Javadoc</a>
built into every running DALServer instance describes the DALServer
classes.<br>
