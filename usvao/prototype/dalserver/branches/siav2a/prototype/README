VAO SIAV2 Prototype
-----------------------

This directory contains files related to the VAO prototype demonstration
of an SIAv2 service.  See the following URLs for details:

BUILDING AND DEPLOYING THE PROTOTYPE
====================================

Installation involves the following:

    - Load metadata for the test data collection into MySQL.
    - Configure the servlet.
    - Build and deploy the servlet.


Loading Metadata

    To load the metadata for the VAO Prototype into a MySQL DBMS, you
    must have MySQL 5.1 or later installed in your system and the mysql
    command in your path.  The username that you will use for writing to
    the database must be already be defined.  Assuming this, you can
    type (from the dalserver distribution base directory):

       prototype/loaddb.sh username password

    where username is the MySQL username and password is the user's
    MySQL password.

    Alternatively, you may edit the USERNAME and PASSWORD parameters at
    the top of the script; then these need not be given on the command
    line:

       prototype/loaddb.sh

    The database can also be loaded via Ant in the base directory of the
    dalserver package:

       ant -Ddb.user=username -Ddb.pass=pw loaddb

    where username and pw are the database username and password
    respectively.  If the -D arguments are not given, they will default
    to the default values hardcoded in the loaddb.sh script.

Configure Servlet

    To configure the servlet for the local installation all one need do
    is edit web/WEB-INF/web.xml.  Either confirm or edit the following
    entries for the service titled "SIAPV2 (...) Prototype Servlet":

	authorityID	Should be changed for a real service, but may
			be left as is for testing.

	dataDirURL	Must point to the root directory of the data
			storage area.

	dbUser		Must be a valid MySQL user (either edit, or
			create the named user).

	dbPassword	Edit as necessary for the dbUser account.

    The other parameters should not need to be changed.

Build and Deploy

    Note, service configuration (above) should be done before deploying
    the service, unless one plans to edit the web.xml in the already
    deployed service.  Deploying the servlet will replace any existing
    web.xml file, along with all other servlet files.

    To build the service merely type "ant dist" in the dalserver root
    directory.  This builds a file dist/ivoa-dal.war.   Either place a
    copy of this file in your Tomcat webapps directory (it will
    automatically be deployed), or use the Tomcat adminstrative Web
    interface to deploy the servlet.

    The link http://localhost:8080/ivoa-dal/siav2query.html should
    display the SIAV2 Web query form.  The link
    http://localhost:8080/ivoa-dal will display all available configured
    DALServer test/demo services.  http://localhost:8080 is the Tomcat
    adminstrative console.
