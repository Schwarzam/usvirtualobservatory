Installing Prerequisite Software

The dalserver toolkit requires a few prerequisite software packages
which are listed in the README file.  This document provides tips for
installing the most common prerequisite options.

Automated Installation Using Your OS Software Manager
=====================================================

On Macs and on most Linux distributions, the prerequisite software can
be installed automatically via the system's software manager.  

Red Hat-based Linux (RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, ScientificLinux)
-----------------------------------------------------------

On Red Hat-based Linux distributions, yum can be used to install the
prerequisites.  You usually need to be a superuser to install software
with yum. 

Before installing java, check to see if you already
have it installed by typing, "javac -version":

  % javac -version
  javac 1.6.0_24

If instead the response is "javac: Command not found" or if the
version is not at least 1.6, then you should install the Java JDK:

  sudo yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel

You can ensure the other prerequisites are installed by running:

  sudo yum install ant tomcat6 mysql

To run dalserver services, you will need to start the tomcat and mysql
servers.  This is done by typing: 

  sudo service mysqld start
  sudo service tomcat6 start

To make sure these start at boot-time, type:

  sudo chkconfig mysqld on
  sudo chkconfig tomcat6 on

When you start working with DALServer toolkit to build a serice, you
will need to set two variables, CATALINA_HOME and CATALINE_BASE.  If
you use Bash shell in your terminal window, type:

  export CATALINE_HOME=/usr/share/tomcat6
  export CATALINA_BASE=/var/lib/tomcat6

For tcsh shell users:

  setenv CATALINE_HOME /usr/share/tomcat6
  setenv CATALINA_BASE /var/lib/tomcat6

Debian-based Linux (Debian, Ubuntu)
-----------------------------------

On Debian-based Linux distributions, apt-get can be used to install the
prerequisites.  You usually need to be a superuser to install software
with apt-get. 

Before installing java, check to see if you already
have it installed by typing, "javac -version":

  % javac -version
  javac 1.6.0_24

If instead the response is "javac: Command not found" or if the
version is not at least 1.6, then you should install the Java JDK:

  sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk

You can ensure the other prerequisites are installed by running:

  sudo apt-get install ant tomcat6 mysql

To run dalserver services, you will need to start the tomcat and mysql
servers.  This is done by typing: 

  sudo service mysqld start
  sudo service tomcat6 start

To make sure these start at boot-time, type:

  sudo chkconfig mysqld on
  sudo chkconfig tomcat6 on

When you start working with DALServer toolkit to build a serice, you
will need to set two variables, CATALINA_HOME and CATALINE_BASE.  If
you use Bash shell in your terminal window, type:

  export CATALINE_HOME=/usr/share/tomcat6
  export CATALINA_BASE=/var/lib/tomcat6

For tcsh shell users:

  setenv CATALINE_HOME /usr/share/tomcat6
  setenv CATALINA_BASE /var/lib/tomcat6
