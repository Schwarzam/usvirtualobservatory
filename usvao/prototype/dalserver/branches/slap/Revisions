Version 0.2  August 2008
----------------------------

[Summary (17 Aug 2008 DCT)]
	Began a round of changes to update the SSAP code to the latest
	(Recommendation) version of the standard.  Incremented version
	to 0.2.  Updated the Web pages and README files.  Other changes:

	* Renamed src/demo to src/dataServices
	* Renamed JhuSsapService to JhuProxyService to retain old code;
	  will keep JhuSsapService as the container for the new version of
	  the DALServer JHU SSAP service (note JHU now has their own native
	  SSA service as well).
	* Changed build.xml to keep "dist" in the distribution, rather
	  than deleting it with "ant clean".  This will cause the Javadocs
	  and servlet WAR file to be included in the source distribution.

	Finalized V0.2 with updated SSAP-related code.



Version 0.1.1  27 June 2007
----------------------------

Revisions +
	Added this revisions file to the DALServer root.  (DCT 25Jun07)

src/dalserver/SsapServlet.java
	Changed version to 0.1.1.  (DCT 27Jun07)

src/dalserver/RequestResponse.java
	Changed the query response format MIME type returned for a
	votable to "application/x-votable+xml" (the previous value of
	"text/xml;x-votable" was incorrect for the query response
	MIME type).  (DCT 27Jun07)

src/demo/JhuSsapService.java
src/dalserver/SsapServlet.java
	1. Added support to the JHU SSA proxy service to support GIF as an
	output graphics format.  This includes a provision to pass-through
	to the remote JHU service any client-specific parameters, e.g.,
	"width=220&height=200&title=no".
	2. Add the parameter pass-through feature for the "native" spectral
	format as well, since this is entirely generated by the remote
	service.  (DCT 27Jun07)

src/dalserver/SsapServlet.java
	Changed the parameter level of ServiceEngine to "extension".
	A bug was causing this to be "client", which was incorrect, plus
	it would interfere with pass-through of client specified params.
	(DCT 27Jun07)

web/index.html
	Added "graphic" as an output format for the JHU proxy SSA service
	in the main query form.  Added a revision number and date to the
	main query page.  (28Jun07)


Version 0.1  25 January 2007
----------------------------
	Initial release.
