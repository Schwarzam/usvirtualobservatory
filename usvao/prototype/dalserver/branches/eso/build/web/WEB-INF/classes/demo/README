DALServer-based Data Services
----------------------------------

Currently there is only one such service, the proxy SSAP service for the Jhu
spectrum services.

To implement your own service, simply add modified versions of the "*Service.java"
and "*Servlet.java" files, and modify web/WEB-INF/web.xml to add the new service
plus set any runtime configuration parameters.  Typing "ant" at the root directory
will recompile the whole package including your new service.  "ant dist" will build
a distribution in the "dist" subdirectory.  This builds a War file in dist
containing the servlet, which one can deploy in a Java application server in
various ways, e.g., by running the manager code in the Tomcat server.
