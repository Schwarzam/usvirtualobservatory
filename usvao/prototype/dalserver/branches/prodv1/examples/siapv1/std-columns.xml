<!--
  -  A description of a required set of columns that must be defined and
  -  and available in the database for the standard queries to function.
  -  The keywords are presented in terms of parameters
  -  and parameter groups.  This file is usually read in by the service
  -  implementation at load-time to configure the service. 
  -
  -  This file describes the required columns for a SIA (Simple Image Access)
  -  service response.
  -
  -  Syntax:
  -  A keyword is described via a <param> element and its component data 
  -  are provided as child elements in two possible ways.
  -
  -  The first way is via a <summary> element, which optimizes for easy 
  -  authoring by hand.  The contents have a "name: value" format, e.g.:

       name:          title
       datatype:      char
       arraysize:     *
       utype:         Line.title
       ucd:           em.line
       description:   small description identifying the line

  -  Each line within the summary tag contains one component of the keyword 
  -  metadata; an end-of-line character indicates the end of the value.  The 
  -  first colon in the line delimits the keyword metadata name from its value.
  -  Spaces before the datum name, before and after the (first) colon, and 
  -  after the value (including the end-of-line character) are discarded.
  -
  -  The second way to specify this metadata is with individual child elements 
  -  named after the metadatum name:

       <name>      title      </name>
       <datatype>  char       </datatype>
       <arraysize> *          </arraysize>
       <utype>     Line.title </utype>
       <ucd>       em.line    </ucd>
       <description> 
          an appropriate but brief string that adequately describes
          the line being presented in the current row to reasonably 
          informed consumer.
       </description>

  -  Like with the summary format, extra space is thrown away before being 
  -  used.  It is different in that values may contain internal end-of-line 
  -  characters (which are collapsed into a single space when parsed).
  -
  -  In either form, a metadatum can only be given once per parameter.  If a 
  -  metadatum is set by both the summary element and its own element, the 
  -  value given by the XML element takes precedence.  Any metadata not set
  -  will be assumed to be undefined unless a default is specified (as below).
  -
  -  The following metadata can be set:
  -    name           a short name of the keyword; this maps to the VOTABLE 
  -                      PARAM attribute, name.  If not provided, the default
  -                      will be the value of "id" (if set) or "utype".
  -    id             a globally unique name for the keyword; maps to the 
  -                      VOTABLE PARAM attribute, id.  If not provided, the 
  -                      default will be the value of "name" (if set) or 
  -                      "utype".
  -    datatype       the computing data type for values associated with this
  -                      parameter.  The default will be assumed to be "char".
  -                      VOTABLE PARAM:  datatype.
  -    arraysize      when given, indicates the shape of array values
  -    canonicalunit  the value unit associated with this keyword according to 
  -                      the data model.  Default is the value of "unit"
  -    unit           the value unit associated with this keyword for the 
  -                      purposes of this service.  Default is the value of 
  -                      "canonicalunit"
  -    utype          the utype describing this keyword
  -    ucd            the UCD describing this keyword
  -    description    a human read-able description of the keyword's meaning
  -    fits           The FITS keyword to use
  -    cvs            the CVS keyword to use
  -    hint          arbitrary processing hint
  -    default        the default value
  -  
  -  The metadata must include at a minimum (via explicitly setting it or 
  -  by default) a name.  
  -
  -  A group is used to indicate that several parameters go together; these
  -  are represented in a similar way.  The <group> element can contain a 
  -  <summary> child and/or individual metadata elements to set the group 
  -  properties.  It then includes the <param> element for each of the 
  -  parameters included in the group.  The following group metadata are 
  -  supported:
  -    name           a short name of the group
  -    id             a globally unique name for the group
  -    utype          the utype describing this keyword
  -    ucd            the UCD describing this keyword
  -    description    a human read-able description of the keyword.
