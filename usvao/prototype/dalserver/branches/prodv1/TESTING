DALServer Unit Test Execution and Development

The DALServer build system includes unit tests written using JUnit
which comes bundled with Ant.  To properly compile and run these
tests, Ant version 1.8.x or later is recommended.  

RUNNING UNIT TESTS
==================

Unit tests may be run with Ant via the "test" target: 

   ant test

This will compile and run the tests.  The output will look something
like this:

   Buildfile: /home/user/dalserver/build.xml

   init:

   test-init:
       [mkdir] Created dir: /home/user/dalserver/build/tclasses

   prepare:

   compile:

   compiletests:
       [javac] Compiling 1 source file to /home/user/dalserver/build/tclasses

   test:
       [junit] Running dalserver.slap.SlapParamSetTest
       [junit] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 0.021 sec

   BUILD SUCCESSFUL
   Total time: 1 second
  
The test result details are written to files in the build/testreports
directory.  If there are any test failures or errors, you can
consult the test report file to find out what went wrong.  

DEVELOPING UNIT TESTS
=====================

Unit tests are written into class files under the tests directory.
When creating a new test, follow these practices:

  o  Create a test class that tests a single source class.

  o  Locate the test class in the same package as the class it is
     testing.  (This simplifies import statements.)

  o  Use tests/dalserver/slap/SlapParamSetTest.java as a model.  In
     particular, use the annotation technique (e.g. "@Test") to
     structure your tests.  

For more information, consult the JUnit documentation available at
http://junit.org.  

Running a Single Test Class
---------------------------

The Ant build script as a few extra targets that are convenient for
testing.  If you just want to run a single test class, try:

   ant -Dtest-class=<test_class_name> testclass

as in,

   ant -Dtest-class=SlapParamSetTest testclass

Notice that you do not need to include the package that the class
belongs to.  

Compiling a Single Class
------------------------

If you just want to compile a single test class (regardless of what
other classes have been updated), try:

   ant -Dsrc-file=<path_to_java_file> compiletestfile

as in,

   ant -Dsrc-file=dalserver/slap/SlapParamSetTest.java compiletestfile

Note that the path is relative to the tests directory.  

Similarly, if you want to compile just a single class under the src
directory, use the "compilefile" target:

   ant -Dsrc-file=dalserver/slap/SlapParamSet.java compilefile
