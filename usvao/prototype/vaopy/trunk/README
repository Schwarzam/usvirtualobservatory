This package respresents an implementation of the VO Data Access Layer
standard python interface.  

This implementation requires the following prerequisite packagss:

  o  numpy (1.6.0 or later)
  o  astropy (0.2 - later versions have a different vo interface)

Currently in this pre-release state, disttool support (or the like) is
not yet supported.  To use, one should set the PYTHONPATH variable to
the location of the "python" directory containing the source code
(i.e. below the directory containing this README).  If the
prerequisites were not installed in the standard python module areas,
these must be included in the PYTHONPATH as well.

UNIT TESTS

Unit tests are contained in the tests subdirectory.  To run a
particular unit test script, type:

   python tests/path-to-script.py

For example:

   python tests/dal/testSIA.py

If the script contains the string "NeedsNet" in its name, it requirs
access to the network to work properly.  All other files do not
require the network, working off of local input files our local
services executed locally on-the-fly.  

A few files aggregate the running of tests from several individual
unit test files.  In particular:

  testNoNet.py -- runs all unit tests that do not require access to
                  the network to work.  
  testNeedsNet.py -- all tests that require the network to work in
                  order to complete.
