This install directory and the build file are *only* used to install the
vaomonitor system (directories/files,etc.) *after* a user  has checked
out a copy of the system from the svn repoistory. Therefore, this directory
and its contents are not part of the production system's environment and
can be safely deleted once the system has been installed in your cgi area.

Required:
*Changes to the build.xml required by user:
 Change the outputDir value to "{yourpath}/validation" in the build.xml file

*The system requires java and a mysql database.
