# The vaomonitor code uses a startup file that

# therefore describes what the content needs to be
# in order to run the system. The user should feel

#
#
# $::cssA          - the css file containing classes for the vaomonitor software.
#
# $::cssB          - the css files containing classes for the vaomonitor sw.
#
# $::valcode       - the vaomonitor cgi web interface. 
#
# $::pw            - the password used to connect to the vaomonitor db 
#
# $::db            - the database name. Should be "vaomonitor"
#
# $::opsdb         - name of the operations db. This should be called vao_operations
#
# $::opspw         - '<your pw for the operations db>';
#
# $::user          - the username used to connect to the validation 
#                    database
#
# $notificationdir - top level notification system directory
#        
# $server          - this is the machine name. E.g. "heasarc". This is only used if the
#                    user needs to have a test area,say, "heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov"
#                    and a development area "heasarcdev.gsfc.nasa.gov". In this case,
#                    you could write "http://$::server.gsfc.nasa.gov" and add a switch
#                    that either sets $::server to "heasarc" or to "heasarcdev".
# 
# $::hosts_file_val - deprecated
