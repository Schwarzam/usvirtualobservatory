Summary:
This directory contains code that ties in with the usvaohome page (www.usvao.org).
The code updates the service status icons for vao services on the vao home page and is used
with other pages including the Science Service Monitor.

SW:
-update_service_icons.pl - the tool that handles the icon updates. This can be called in
a cgi and command line context. However, it would be better to invoke this tool inside another
cgi tool since this script is meant to run under the hood (i.e. the vao notification tool calls
this tool dynamically).
-Connect/* - code to connect to your MySQL db.
-SQL/* - queries 

What's needed to run this:
a) a publicly writeable tmp area where users have permissions to make updates via a cgi tool.
b) a tmp area where the icons can be stored,probably the same area used in (a)
c) an xml status file that contains the current status of each of the vao services. This can be generated
by calling the vaomonitor tool using:
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/vo/vaomonitor/vaodb.pl?format=xml

The xml status file is currently called "status.xml". The user may wish to rename this but must edit
the update_service_icons.pl script to point to the correct path and filename.
d)a MySQL DB that has the appropriate tables and columns (i.e. the vo_operations db containing the vao_notices
table
