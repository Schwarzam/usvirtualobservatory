The HEASARC has continued validating all Cone and SIAP services in the VO registry. 
To date, there are 6530 Cone and SIAP services that we are testing.Of these 2915 services
(approximately 45%)  have passed validation, 3502 services (approximately 54.2%) have
failed, and only 38 (.58%) were aborted. Aborted tests are the result of communication
issues with the server and these issues are being resolved. Failed tests on the other
hand are due to existing issues with services that do not agree in one way or another
with existing VO specifications.

As part of this effort, we have also sent reports to various centers summarizing the results
of our validation tests on their sites. There are a total of 43 centers whose services we 
have validated. As of the end of October,  we have sent 19 messages to 19 centers and 
received 12  responses from 12 centers. Responses have been relatively quick and curators 
have been eager to implement fixes. Subsequent retesting of services at each host institution
have for the most part shown a substantial decrease in the failure rate of Cone and SIAP services.

Among the various data centers, not including CDS,LEDAS or HEASARC, we have noted that there are
a few specific error types that occur with relative frequency. These include:

The TABLE must contain exactly one FIELD with ucd='ID_MAIN'.
The POS_EQ_DEC_MAIN column must have datatype='double'.
The TABLE must contain exactly one FIELD with ucd='POS_EQ_DEC_MAIN'.
The TABLE must contain exactly one FIELD or PARAM with ucd='POS_EQ_RA_MAIN'.
Apparent Communication Error.

Apparent Communication Errors appear to be transient in nature. The service may
have been unavailable at the time validtion was performed. Re-validating the
service at a future point may show that the service is indeed valid.


Among the 3 primary centers, there seems to be a similar trend. The most
common errors are:

The TABLE must contain exactly one FIELD with ucd='ID_MAIN'.(all three centers)
The ID_MAIN column must have datatype='char'. (only heasarc and ledas)
The ID_MAIN column must have a string-appropriate arraysize (recommend '*'). (Only ledas)
The POS_EQ_RA_MAIN column must have datatype='double'. (only cds and ledas)
Error message must appear in an INFO or PARAM with name='Error' in required location (only CDS)



So far there are only 3 centers that are 100% compliant - SVO Amiga, Harvard
ADS and the Vatican. However, Each of these centers hosts only one service so the validation
statistics were only marginally improved once these services were fixed.
