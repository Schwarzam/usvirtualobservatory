nValidation (how to run)

-This directory contains the code necessary to
retrive resources from the vo registry, update
the db with new resources and perform the 
validation of those resources. The directory
also contains the client side cgi program to
view the results.

Directory structure:

vresults.pl - client side cgi application to view
              results

SQL -   dir containing code for vresults.pl
HTML-   dir containing code fro vresults.pl
Table - dir containing code for vresults.pl

doc - dir containing information on the validation
system.

java - the dir containing the java package that
performs validation.

perl - the dir containing the code to retrieve the
vo resources from the registry,parse the resources,
and update our db.

Everything runs under a cron job. Example of a full
end to end run is as follows.

Run:
1)get_registry_cone_siap.pl (this retrieves all types of
   data: cone,siap,etc.)
2)parse_registry_resources.pl (this parses all types of 
  data that *have been downloaded locally*)
3)updatedb.pl (this uses the files created by (2) to
update our nmysql db with new data)

Then in the java dir, run:
4)java Test 

5) view results by going to:

http://heasarcdev.gsfc.nasa.gov/vo/validation/vresults.pl


*Right now the scripts above use "-t siap" to download the SIAP
services only. You can also use "-t cone" to download only the
Cone services. In the longrun we may want all types downloaded 
at once to one file. However to provide more flexibility and
control over the dowload,update, and validation cycle, I have
provide the above command line options for now.
