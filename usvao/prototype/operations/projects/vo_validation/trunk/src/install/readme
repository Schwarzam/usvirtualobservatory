Overview:
This install directory and the build file are used to install the
validation system into a user's CGI area. A fresh checked out copy of the system must exist
prior to running the install script.


Required:
It is assumed that the user will:
a)check out a copy of the system to a local directory
b)will want a separate directory where the production area code will live ( This will be
a CGI area on the user's system
c)have a MySQL db with the appropriate tables and columns in place.(See Google docs
on what this should look like when first setting this up).
d)have java and perl running on their server.
e)have mysqlconnector set up on their server so that java can communicate with the MySQL DB


Changes to the build.xml:
a) Change the basedir path to the directory in which you installed the svn checked out
version of this system. The user should point to the src directory here. 
b) Change the outPutDir path to the target directory where you want the production version
of this system to live (this would be your cgi area). 

Run:
From the install directory, run: ant -v
