Running  Validation manually:

*These are very short instructions on how to run
the validation system manually in case things stop
running for whatever reason. 

*How things work (Top level):
-perl scripts download resources from the STScI registry via a cron job (daily)
-perl scripts parse the resources and store metadata in the MySQL validation
database (done daily via cron job)
-/htdocs/vo/validation/run_java.sh  runs daily and validates 300 services per night in
the aformentioned MySQL validation db.
-you manually view the results at: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov//vo/validation/
 
*Quick Start to run everything by hand:
1) cd to: htdocs/vo/validation/perl
2) run the following scripts in this order with no options:
./get_datatypes.pl
./parse_registry_resources.pl
3)verify that you now have files of the form {type}_res_for_validation in /www/htdocs/vo/validation/perl/dump
4) run the following script with no options (you are still in the perl directory here):
./updatedb.pl
5)cd to : /www/htdocs/vo/validation/java 
6) compile the java classes:
javac *java
7) run the Test class to validate 300 resources by doing:
java Test 

That's it. You have:
a)downloaded vo services and updated our db 
b)validated 300 services.

To see the results just go to:

N.B. Minor adjustments that you may want to try...
Q. 
How do you change the default number validated per day to something other than 300? 
A. Change the default number in: /www/htdocs/vo/validation/data/number_to_validate

Q. How do you get more documentation?
A. Go to:  /www/htdocs/vo/validation/doc

Q. How do you tweak the symbols table  vars used in the programs?
A. Go to: /www/htdocs/vo/validation/data/startup.pm

Q. Some SIAP and SSA test fail because the Image cannot be found. What
is the solution here?
A. See if the RA and DEC needs to be changed such that the respone includes
URLs to the images. You can manually change the default RA and DECs by using
the overide file in: /www/htdocs/vo/validation/data/override
