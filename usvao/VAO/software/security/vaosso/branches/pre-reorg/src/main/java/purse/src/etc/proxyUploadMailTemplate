In order to do this, you need to put a file named "cog.properties" in 
your .globus directory, which is located in your home directory. 

This is an example of a cog.properties file:

usercert=/Users/madduri/.globus/usercert.pem
userkey=/Users/madduri/.globus/userkey.pem
proxy=/tmp/x509up_u1811
cacert=/etc/grid-security/certificates/

Please fill in appropriate values for your machine.   Note that the home
directory on Microsoft Windows machines is C:\Documents And Settings\<user>.
