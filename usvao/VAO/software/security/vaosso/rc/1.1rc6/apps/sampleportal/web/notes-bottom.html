  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <h3>Design: goal and constraints</h3>
  <p>
      A portal may wish to (a) associate auxiliary data such as email data with a new user account and
      (b) not require the user to type it twice.  The NVO single-signon registration process provides a
      mechanism to do this that may seem cumbersome, but two constraints dictate its design:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          The portal cannot see which usernames are available prior to registration.
      </li>
      <li>
          The user's privacy rights prevent the NVO signon service from sharing personal information such as
          email address or actual name, without the user's consent.
      </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a href="index.jsp">Step 1: Local Registration</a></h3>
  <p>
      Create a local user account, with whatever information you want to correlate to an NVO login.
      In this example, name, email, institution, and favorite color.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="save.jsp">Step 2: Local Storage</a></h3>
  <p>
      Save the information locally, and generate a unique registration token to go with it. The token
      <em>should not be guessable</em> (for example, a random 64-bit long should be sufficient),
      so that attackers cannot hijack your site's registrations.
      You'll use this token in <a href="local_retrieval">Step 4</a> to associate an NVO Identity with the new user's information.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3: NVO Registration</h3>
  <p>(Click a <u>register</u> link for one of the local users created in Steps 1 and 2.)</p>
  <p>
      Send the user to <a href="<%=Config.getRegUrl(getServletConfig())%>">NVO registration</a>.
      Be sure your link to NVO registration is via <em>https</em>, to avoid interception of the unique ID you have assigned to the user.
      You may optionally include name, email, phone, and/or institution as parameters in the registration URL.
      Include a <tt>returnURL</tt> in the registration URL that links to <a href="local_retrieval">Step 4</a> and includes the user's local ID.
      See <a href="#choosing_a_returnurl">choosing a <tt>returnURL</tt></a> below for more details.
  </p>

  <a name="local_retrieval"></a>
  <h3><a href="return.jsp">Step 4: Local Confirmation and Correlation</a></h3>
  <p>
      When NVO registration sends the user back to the <tt>returnURL</tt> specified in Step 3, you can correlate the NVO
      username to a local user account (created in Step 1), using the unique ID you generated in Step 2.  There are two
      ways to retrieve the NVO username:
  </p>
  <ol>
      <li>
          The <tt>user</tt> parameter, which NVO will append to your <tt>returnURL</tt>.  For example, if your
          <tt>returnURL</tt> was <tt>http://example.edu/regcomplete?user_token=abcdef</tt>, NVO will modify it to be
          <tt>http://example.edu/regcomplete?user_token=abcdef&user=&lt;username&gt;</tt>. This is the simpler approach,
          since it only requires the user to click a link in their confirmation email, and not login to the NVO.
      </li>
      <li>
          If your <tt>returnURL</tt> requires an <a
          href="http://mywiki.ncsa.uiuc.edu/wiki/NVO_SSO_Installation#Pubcookie_Client">NVO SSO login</a>, then
          <tt>REMOTE_USER</tt> will be set to the NVO username. This is a <strong>more secure</strong> approach, since
          it requires both the user's password and their registration token, but it is also <strong>more
          error-prone</strong>, since it relies on the user to both click on a link in their confirmation email and
          login successfully to the NVO.  For more details, see <a href="#choosing_a_returnurl">Choosing a
          <tt>returnURL</tt></a>, below.
      </li>
  </ol>

  <a name="choosing_a_returnurl"></a><h2>Choosing a <tt>returnURL</tt></h2>

  <p>
    Your site's <tt>returnURL</tt>, which users will be sent to after they complete the NVO registration process, serves
    two purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Control where your users land after the registration process.</li>
    <li>Link local user accounts to NVO IDs (see <a href="#local_retrieval">step 4</a>).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When you choose a <tt>returnURL</tt>, you will choose whether it requires authentication with an NVO login or
    not&#8212;that is, is it protected by Pubcookie authentication or is it in an open part of your site?  
  </p>
  <p>
    The diagram at the right illustrates the two design choices:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The left path, <b>authn required</b>, is fragile because users may fail to login to the NVO, leaving them
    confirmed with the NVO but not locally.</li>
    <li>The right path, <b>open</b>, is more robust because it doesn't require users to login to the NVO until after
    their registration confirmation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The NVO strongly recommends that your returnURL <strong>not require authentication</strong>, in order to prevent
    confirmation failures.  Experience has shown that users <strong>frequently fail to log in</strong> during
    confirmation, probably because they believe that clicking on the confirmation link that they received via email is
    sufficient to complete their registration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that if you choose to have your <tt>returnURL</tt> go to a public part of your site, you should include a
    secret in it that an attacker would be unlikely to guess.  For example, you can generate a random text string for
    each of your local users, include it in the returnURL, and use it to identify them securely.  <i>You should not use
    the user's email address because an attacker could use it to impersonate the user and gain control of their local
    account.</i>

  <a name="sample_implementation"></a><h2>Sample Implementation</h2>
  <h3>Running under Tomcat</h3>
  <p>
      This example should be straightforward to implement using any language and framework.  This particular implementation runs as JSP pages under Tomcat,
      behind <a href="http://mywiki.ncsa.uiuc.edu/wiki/NVO_SSO_Installation#Pubcookie_Client">Pubcookie-based NVO Single-Signon</a>.
      It uses <tt>mod_proxy_ajp</tt> to connect incoming connections through Apache to Tomcat. Tomcat's internal authentication mechanism is disabled
      in order to accept Pubcookie authentication in Step 4, by modifying <tt>server.xml</tt>.  The AJP connector configuration is:
      <tt>&lt;Connector port="8009" <b>tomcatAuthentication="false"</b> enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443" protocol="AJP/1.3" /&gt;</tt>.
      That way, the NVO username is available simply as <tt>request.getRemoteUser()</tt>.
