Hello @fullname@,

We received a request at the Our Login Services site (hopefully from
you!) to allow you to reset your forgotten password for the @username@
login.  To confirm that this was actually you, we've sent you a
confirmation token below.  To reset your password, you can do one of
two things: 

  o  Visit @passservices@ and
     enter the token below along with your username into the form 
     under "Reset Your Password" and hit submit.

     Confirmation Token: @token@

     -- OR --

  o  Simply access this link

     @url@

We will then allow you to reset your password.

If you did not request a password reset, you may ignore this message;
however, we sure would like to hear about possible misuses of this
service or any other problems you may be having.  Please contact us at
@helpemail@ or through the Our contact page at

The Our Logon Team.
