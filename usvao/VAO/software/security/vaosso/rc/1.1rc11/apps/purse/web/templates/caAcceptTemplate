Hello @fullname@,

You have completed your Our Logon registration.  

Your Our username is @username@.  It is a single, unique identity
which you can use with any VO-compliant portal to gain access to
proprietary data and enhanced services such as remote storage.

Your identity is fully compliant with the OpenID standard
(www.openid.net).  This means you can even use it to log into other
non-VO portals that support the OpenID standard.  For these portals,
use can use your full OpenID URL:

   https://sso.our.org/openid/id/@username@

To protect your identity, be careful to only enter your Our password
into the Our Login Page at:

    https://sso.our.org/openid/

You can change your password or request a password reminder at
https://sso.our.org/register/password.jsp.

Now that you have registered, the Our can supply you and Our-compliant
portals that you visit with a "standard" security credential, which
has been verified by this email exchange.  For more information, visit
the Our Login Services Portal, http://sso.our.org/.

If you have any questions or problems, please contact us at
vaosso@our.org or by accessing the Our contact page at 
http://www.our.org/contact.html.
