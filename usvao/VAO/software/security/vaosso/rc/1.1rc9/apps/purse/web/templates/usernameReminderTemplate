Hello @fullname@,

We received a request at the VAO Login Services site (hopefully from
you!) to remind you of your VAO username.  Below is a list of all of
the usernames we have associated with your email address (shown in the
"To:" field above): 
@usernames@

(Note that we don't encourage you to keep more than one account.  If
you wish to drop any of the above accounts, please contact us at 
@helpemail@.)

Usernames above appended with an asterisk indicate that you have not
yet activated that account by confirming your email address.  You
cannot use that account until you have activated it.  For your
convenience, we have resent an email message that explains how to do
that.  If you do not wish to use that account, you can ignore that
message.  

Have you also forgotten your password, too?  You can request to reset
it for one of the accounts below by accessing the appropriate URL.  
Alternatively, you can visit our account reminder page at 
@passservices@, where you can enter your username and the special
token listed below.
@resets@
If you have any questions or problems, please contact us at
accessing the VAO contact page at http://www.usvao.org/contact-connect
Please include "VAO Logins" in the subject line.
