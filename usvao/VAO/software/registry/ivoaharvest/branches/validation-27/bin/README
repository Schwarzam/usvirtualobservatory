Note about the "comply" executable and related files:

comply is a program that tests compliance with the OAI-MHP standard.
The version provided here has been compiled and statically linked for
Linux; there is no expectation that it will work on any Linux platform
other than the one it was built on.  The validater application can be
configured not to use this; in this case, the on-line service version
will be used (at reduced performance).

The related files in the bin directory are:

   comply
   enus.lan
   lynx.pl
