it is known as a Tabular Sky Service.

        SIA uses HTTP GET queries to encode query arguments in the request
URL. It specifies a number of optional parameters that can control what images are returned, how cut-outs are to be made, and what formats to provide. It also
allows the data provider to support non-standard arguments.
