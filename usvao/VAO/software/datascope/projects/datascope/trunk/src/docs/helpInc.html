<h2> How to use DataScope </h2>
<p>
The NVO DataScope tool queries hundreds of astronomical
services about a given location or region and organizes the
information so that you can browse it, select data for download,
or pass it into compatible tools for further analysis
<h4> Starting DataScope </h4>
To start DataScope, just enter a position and size in the
two fields provided and submit the query.  You can enter
the position as a target name, or in sexagesimal or decimal
coordinaets.  Many formats are supported.  The size is specified
in decimal degrees.
<p>
Once you submit a query DataScope will start a query of registered
resources that can be queried at that position.  A result form
will pop up and show you the kinds of responses you get. 
<p>
If you wish to make sure to get fresh results you can click a checkbox
to skip the cache.  Similarly the DataScope checks once an hour
to see what resources are available to be queried.  You can ask for
this to be updated before your query by checking "Refresh registry" box.
<p>
A few recent queries are shown at the bottom of the page but you can
leave your query off the list by clicking on the third checkbox.
<h3> Query results </h3>
<p>
The DataScope should immediately return with a page that begins
to organize the results.  If the results have already been cached
the form will show the previously queried data.  If you are starting
a new query it will gather results over a period of a few minutes.
A status section at the top of the query result page shows the progress
of the query, the number of resources found and how long ago the query was
initiated.  All other data is organized
into tabbed panels below the status area
You can jump to any of the panels at any time.  Just
click on the panels' tabs at the top of the page.

<h4> Summary </h4>
The Summary panel summarizes the request, shows
an optical image of the region and indicates how many files
you have selected for further analysis.  Initially no files are
selected.
<p>
This is where you launch analysis tools like Aladin or initiate
a download of data to your local machine of the selected files.

<h4> Resources </h4>
This panel links to all the data that has been returned.  You can
click on a resource name to view data from that resource.
All resources that have been queried which have some data
in the requested region are shown.  
Resources are broken into four major categories:
<ul>
<li>
Key multiwavelength services (NED, SIMBAD, ADS and <i>SkyView</i>).  These
include both object and image services. The object services provide links
to ADS, NED and SIMBAD queries for the returned bibcodes or objects.  You can
browse the images in the SkyView and NED images services just like the
other images services described below.
<li>
Image services.  These services return a list of images.  You can view individual images or
select any FITS image for download into a TAR file or analysis with Aladin or OASIS.
<li>Observations.  These services are queries of catalogs of observations.  In
many cases a link to the archive data is available.
<li>Object catalogs.  These services list objects found in the region.
</ul>
Images and observations
are sub-divided according to the wavelength, while object catalogs are
organized according to object type.
<p>
What's the difference between Images and Observations?<br>
The Image services are those services which return images regardless
of the origin, e.g., the image may be dynamically generated from
survey data, or it may correspond to a single observation of some
observatory.  An observation is a single collection of data taken
by an observatory typically of some target for a given observer.
There may or may not be images that were taken as part of any given
observation.  In  many cases DataScope gives links to the archive
data for an observation, but this is not always possible, sometimes
only a table of the characteristics of the observation is available.
The observation
data may include spectra and time series as well as or instead of  observations.
<p>
Sometimes a data provider will provide multiple methods of accessing
their data so that DataScope lists the service in both the Images and Observations
area. The Images links will always have some underlying data.
Observations links may or may not
have links to underlying data, and can also include spectra and other non-image
types of observations.
<p>
You can control which categories are displayed.  Each category label
is preceded by a minus sign, e.g., <tt><img src=/vo/datascope/images/minus.gif>Major Multiwavelength Services</tt>,
Click on the <img src=/vo/datascope/images/minus.gif>to collapse the category.
The resources in that category will disappear.
Just the label will be left, preceded by <img src=/vo/datascope/images/plus.gif>(N) where
N is the number of resources in the collapsed tree.
Click on the + to restore the category.
<p>
Each resource is displayed in the format<br>
<tt>   <form><input type=checkbox> Name (n) ?</form></tt><br>
Click on the <tt>Name</tt> to display the data returned by
the resource.  This will be displayed in the Data panel and you'll
move there automatically.
The '?' links to the metadata for the resource, i.e., a structured
description of the resource as a whole. 
<p>
Use the checkbox to select this table data for further analysis
in Aladin or OASIS or to download the data. (See the Summary panel.)
This checkbox selects only the table data.  If
there are FITS files indexed by this table, then you first need to
view this table by clicking on the name, and then select the
FITS images you wish to analyze.
<p>
To keep the page manageable, short names
are used to describe the resource.  To get a longer name let your
mouse hover over a name for a second.  A tool-tip box should
appear giving more information about the resource.  For still
more data click on the ? to get the full metadata on the resource.
<p>
After the name the number of rows in the resource is given
as <tt>(n)</tt>.  If you have selected FITS files within a resource,
the resource name will be shaded, and the tooltip that comes
up when you hover over the resource will indicate the
number of files you have selected.
<p>

<h4> Data Table </h4>


The Data panel is used to view the results from a resource.
Normally you get to the Data panel by clicking on a resource name in the
Resources page, but you can also get back to the last selected
resource by clicking on the panel's tab.
<p>
For many resources (MAST and HEASARC archive tables, ADS, NED and SIMBAD)
the DataScope provides links into the native services.  There may be a "Data"
link at the beginning of each row, or one of the columns may be a link
into the system.
<p>
If the row indexes a FITS file, then there will
be a checkbox at the beginning of the row.  Just click on the checkbox
to select that file for further analysis.  This works like
a shopping cart.  Go to the Summary
pane when you have made all of your selections and are ready to save
the data or send it to an analysis tool.
<p>
For rows linking to FITS files there will also be <tt>View</tt> and <tt>FOV</tt> links.  the
first links to a program that renders the FITS file for quick look viewing.
The second outlines the region contained in this file over an optical
image of the region.
<p>
The top of the Data Table panel includes a number of links.
<ul>
<li> ASCII links to a simple ASCII rendering of the table
<li> The MetaData link links to the table's metadata.
<li> The XML link links to the actual XML download.
<!-- <li> The VOStat link copies the file to VOStat, a simple statistics utility. -->
<li> The VOPlot link loads the file into VOPlot a powerful plotting applet.
<li> The Overlay link plots the positions onto an optical image of the
region.  Only rows that are actually in the region will be shown.
</ul>
<p>
The table displaying the data is dynamic.  Row paging is provided, and the table 
can be sorted and filtered based on the column values.  A widget below the main table 
can be used to change the column order and indicate which columns are displayed.  Note 
that all columns are not displayed by default.  Buttons are provided to reset all 
settings to their default values.

<h4> No Data </h4>

This panel lists the resources for which no data was found. You can
view the metadata for each resource by clicking on the name.  Some
resources will have an '*' after the name.  This indicates that the
resource was not actually queried, but that a resource filter provided
by the host institution indicated that there was no data in this region.

<h4> Processing </h4>

This panel lists resources which have not yet been processed.
As processing continues this list should grow shorter.  The name
links to the resource metadata.

<h4> Errors </h4>

This panel lists resources where an error was encountered during
processing.  The exception which caused the error is listed.
<p>
Timeout errors may indicate that the service was simply too busy
to return data in the time alloted.  A FileNotFound exception indicates
that the URL is invalid.  There may also be parsing errors for some services.

<h4> Help </h4>

The help panel displays this text.

<h4> The status area. </h4>

At the very top of the page the Status line gives the status of the
request.  While a request is underway the program will give the fraction
of resources that are searched and the number of resources that have matched.
These will update automatically.  You can turn these updates off by
clicking on the appropriate link.  If you have turned automatic
updates off, you should see links that will do a single update, and
turn automatic updating back on.


<h3> Questions </h3>

<dt> What windows does DataScope create?
<dd> DataScope uses a window with HTML target of "extern" to
diplay images, resource metadata and to run Aladin and OASIS.

<dt> How does DataScope update dynamically?
<dd> DataScope uses AJAX style queries to download a small
file that indicates the status of a query you have initiated.

<dt> Can I run DataScope with JavaScript turned off?
No.  Well you can, but you won't see anything!
