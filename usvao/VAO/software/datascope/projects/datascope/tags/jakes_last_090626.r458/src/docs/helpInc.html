<h2> How to use DataScope </h2>
<p>
The NVO DataScope tool queries hundreds of astronomical
services about a given location or region and organizes the
information so that you can browse it, select data for download,
or pass it into compatible tools for further analysis
</p>
<h4> Starting DataScope </h4>
<p>
To start DataScope, just enter a position, radius and units in the
fields provided and submit the query.  You can enter
the position as a target name, or in sexagesimal or decimal
coordinates.  Many formats are supported.
</p>
<p>
Once you submit a query DataScope will start a query of registered
resources that can be queried at that position.  A result form
will pop up and show you the kinds of responses you get. 
</p>
<p>
If you wish to make sure to get fresh results you can click checkbox
that skips the cache.  Similarly the DataScope checks once an hour
to see what resources are available to be queried.  You can ask for
this to be updated before your query by checking "Refresh registry" box.
</p>
<p>
A few recent queries are shown at the bottom of the page but you can
leave your query off the list by clicking on the third checkbox.
</p>
<h3> Query results </h3>
<p>
The DataScope should immediately return with a page that begins
to organize the results.  If the results have already been cached
the form will show the previously queried data.  If you are starting
a new query it will gather results over a period of a few minutes.
A status section at the top of the query result page shows the progress
of the query, the number of resources found and how long ago the query was
initiated.  All other data is organized
into tabbed panels below the status area
You can jump to any of the panels at any time.  Just
click on the panels' tabs at the top of the page.
</p>

<h4> Summary </h4>
<p>
The Summary panel summarizes the request, shows
an optical image of the region and indicates how many files
you have selected for further analysis.  Initially no files are
selected.
</p>
<p>
This is where
where you launch analysis tools like Aladin or initiate
a download of data to your local machine of the selected files.
</p>

<h4> Resources </h4>
<p>
This panel links to all the data that has been returned.
All resources that have been queried which have some data
in the requested region are shown.  Resources are broken into four major categories:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Key multiwavelength services (NED, SIMBAD, ADS and SkyView).  These
include both object and image services. The object services provide links
to ADS, NED and SIMBAD queries for the returned bibcodes or objects.  You can
browse the images in the SkyView and NED images services just like the
other images services described below.
<li>
Image services.  These services return a list of images.  You can view the images or
select any FITS image for download into a TAR file or analysis with Aladin or OASIS.

<li>Observations.  These services are queries of catalogs of observations.  In
many cases a link to the archive data is available.
<li>Object catalogs.  These services list objects found in the region.
</ul>
<p>
Images and observations
are sub-divided according to the wavelength, while object catalogs are
organized according to object type.
</p>
<p>
What's the difference between Images and Observations?<br>
The Image services are those services which return images regardless
of the origin, e.g., the image may be dynamically generated from
survey data, or it may correspond to a single observation of some
observatory.  An observation is a single collection of data taken
by an observatory.  There may or may not be images that were taken as part of the
observation.  In many cases DataScope gives links to the archive
data for an observation, but this is not always possible.  The observation
data may include spectra and time series rather than observations.
Often a data provider will provide multiple methods of accessing
their data so that DataScope lists the service in both the Images and Observations
area. To summarize, the Images links will always have some underlying data
underneath them, but for images.  Observations links may or may not
have links to underlying data, but can include spectra and other non-image
types of observations.
</p>
<p>
You can control which categories are displayed.  Each category label
is preceded by a minus sign, e.g., <tt>- Major Multiwavelength Services</tt>,
Click on the minus sign (<tt>-</tt>) before the label to collapse the category.
The resources in that category will disappear.
Just the label will be left and preceded by +(N) whre
N is the number of resources that in the collapsed tree.
Click on the + to restore the category.
</p>
<p>
Each resource is displayed in the format<br>
<tt>   <form><input type='checkbox'> Name (n/m) ?</form></tt><br>
Click on the <tt>name</tt> to display the data returned by
the resource.  This will be displayed in the Data panel and you'll
move there automatically.
The '?' links to the metadata for the resource, i.e., a structured
description of the resource.
</p>
<p>
Use the checkbox to select this table data for further analysis
in Aladin or OASIS or to download the data. (See the Summary panel.)
This checkbox selects only the table data.  If
there are FITS files indexed by this table, then you first need to
view this table by clicking on the name, and then select the
FITS images you wish to analyze.
</p>
<p>
To keep the page manageable, short names
are used to describe the resource.  To get a longer name let your
mouse hover over a name for a second.  A tool-tip box should
appear giving more information about the resource.  For still
more data click on the ? to get the full metadata on the resource.
</p>
<p>
After the name the number of rows in the resource is given.
This is given as <tt>(m/n)</tt> if there are FITS files indexed, or just
as <tt>(n)</tt> if this is a table that does not index any data files.
The value <tt>m</tt> gives the number of the FITS files that
you have currently selected, while <tt>n</tt> gives either the number
of rows in the table, or the number of FITS files available if any.
</p>

<h4> Data Table </h4>

<p>
The Data panel is used to view the results from a resource.
Normally you get to the Data panel by clicking on a resource name in the
Resources page, but you can also get back to the last selected
resource by clicking on the panel's tab.
</p>
<p>
For many resources (MAST and HEASARC archive tables, ADS, NED and SIMBAD)
the DataScope provides links into the native services.  There may be a "Data"
link at the beginning of each row, or one of the columns may be a link
into the system.
</p>
<p>
If the row indexes a FITS files, then there will
be a checkbox at the beginning of the row.  Just click on the checkbox
to select that file for further analysis.  This works rather like
a shopping cart.  Go to the Summary
page when you have made all of your selections and are ready to save
the data or send it to an analysis tool.
</p>
<p>
For rows linking to FITS files there will be <tt>View</tt> and <tt>FOV</tt> links.  the
first links to a program that renders the FITS file for quick look viewing.
The second outlines the region contained in this file over an optical
image of the region.
</p>
<p>
There will also be <tt>View</tt> links for rows that link to non-FITS files.  These
just download the linked data (typically GIF or JPEG images, or occasionally
HTML pages).
</p>

<p>
The top of the Data Table panel includes a number of links.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The MetaData link links to the table's metadata.
<li> The XML link links to the actual XML download.
<li> The VOStat link copies the file to VOStat, a simple statistics utility.
<li> The VOPlot link loads the file into VOPlot a powerful plotting applet.
<li> The Overlay link plots the positions onto an optical image of the
region.  Only rows that are actually in the region will be shown.
</ul>


<h4> No Data </h4>
<p>
This panel lists the resources for which no data was found. You can
view the metadata for each resource by clicking on the name.  Some
resources will have an '*' after the name.  This indicates that the
resource was not actually queried, but that a resource filter provided
by the host institution indicated that there was no data in this region.
</p>

<h4> Processing </h4>
<p>
This panel lists resources which have not yet been processed.
As processing continues this list should grow shorter.  The name
links to the resource metadata.
</p>

<h4> Errors </h4>
<p>
This panel lists resources where an error was encountered during
processing.  The exception which caused the error is listed.
</p>
<p>
Timeout errors may indicate that the service was simply too busy
to return data in the time alloted.  A FileNotFound exception indicates
that the URL is invalid.  There may also be parsing errors for some services.
</p>

<h4> Help </h4>
<p>
The help panel displays this text.
</p>

<h4> The status area. </h4>
<p>
At teh very top of the page the Status line gives the status of the
request.  While a request is underway the program will give the fraction
of resources that are searched and the number of resources that have matched.
These will update automatically.  You can turn these updates off by
clicking on the appropriate link.  If you have turned automatic
updates off, you should see links that will do a single update, and
turn automatic updating back on.
</p>


<h3> Questions </h3>

<dl>
<dt> Why does the DataScope run in a special window?</dt>
<dd> Navigation in the DataScope uses the tabbed panels which are
quite easy to get around with.  However many users find that they
automatically use the Back button to get to the 'previous' page.
By eliminating this button, we hope that user's will not accidentally
leave the program.  Just close the window when you are done with
DataScope.</dd>

<dt> What windows does DataScope create?</dt>
<dd> DataScope uses a window with HTML target of "extern" to
diplay images, resource metadata and to run Aladin and OASIS.</dd>

<dt> How does DataScope update dynamically?</dt>
<dd> DataScope uses AJAX style queries to download a small
file that indicates the status of a query you have initiated.</dd>

<dt> Can I run DataScope with JavaScript turned off?</dt>
<dd>No.  Well you can, but you won't see anything!</dd>
