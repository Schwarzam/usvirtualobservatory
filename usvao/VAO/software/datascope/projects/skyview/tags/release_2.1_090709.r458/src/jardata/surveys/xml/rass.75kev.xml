<i> The following is adapted from the MPI FTP site information: 7/16/97
</i><br>
These maps present the initial version of the results from the
ROSAT soft X-ray all-sky survey as presented in ApJ 454, 643.
The maps cover approximately 98% of the sky in the 1/4 keV, 3/4 keV, 
and 1.5 keV bands, with about 2&#176 angular resolution and high 
sensitivity for low surface brightness extended features.  
The effects of non-X-ray contamination and X-rays of solar system 
origin have been eliminated to the greatest possible extent, but 
discrete X-ray sources have not been removed.  
The much improved angular resolution, statistical precision, and 
completeness of coverage of these maps reveals considerable structure 
over the entire 0.1-2.0 keV energy range that was not observed 
previously. The data compare well with previous all-sky surveys in 
terms of absolute normalization and zero point.
<p>
SkyView also has two other sets of surveys derived from the RASS data
with substantially higher resolution.
The surveys whose
names begin with RASS3 are counts maps with 45" pixels.  The
RASS or RASSInt surveys are intensity maps generated by dividing
the counts maps with the exposure maps provided by MPE.
