  <Description>
   <![CDATA[
This survey includes high-resolution all sky optical images in two colors. 
This survey is not local to <i>SkyView</i>, it is served remotely from 
the <a href=http://www-gsss.stsci.edu> ST ScI </a>.
Processing of the survey is ongoing.  The current state
is of each of the elements is described in the 
<a href=http://www-gsss.stsci.edu/PlateMaterial/plateMaterial.htm#DSSIIPlates>
plate status table </a> at the ST ScI.
<P>
Data are retrieved from the ST ScI site in 18' tiles that are cached at the
<I>SkyView</i> server.  Thus users may note that when multiple images are retrieved
from near the same region, the first request takes substantially longer.
<p>
The native projection of these data is described as a high-order polynomial
distortion of a gnomonic projection using the same terms as the DSS.
