		      VO-CLI v1.0 Tools README File
		     ===============================

    This directory contains the source and documentation for the
VO-CLI (VO Command-Line Interface) tools.  See the INSTALL file for
detailed installation instructions.

    The VO-CLI Tools consist of the following tasks:

   	         vodata	- query and access VO data services
	       vosesame	- call the Sesame name resolver service
	     voregistry	- NVO Registry search client

Additional tasks will be added in future versions.  Together, these tasks
provide desktop access to VO data services, combined with functionality to
resolve object names and data resources using the Registry.  A key
objective of this package is to provide an astronomer friendly interface to
the VO that conceals the infrastructure used to make it all work.

	INSTALL			Installation instructions

	lib/			Libraries needed by tasks

	voclient/		VOClient source direcory
	voclient.jars/		Supporting JAR files directory
	voclientd		VOClient daemon command script.

    The 'voclientd' command MUST be in the same directory as the
'voclient.jars' directory to operate properly.  The task binaries, the
voclientd and the voclient.jars directory may all be installed in a system
directory common to all users, or in a user-specific path.  The 'voclientd'
will be started automatically by tasks that need it, so long as the command
can be found in the user's default environment.
    The JAR files included in this distribution are platform-independent.
Binary releases will be specific to a particular platform but the package
should compile from source under Linux, Mac OSX, or Cygwin.  The VOClient
daemon required Java 1.5 to be installed, necessary JAR files are included.

    Please report any bugs, comments, or suggestions to the author
(fitz@noao.edu) or the NVO Help Desk (feedback@us-vo.org).
