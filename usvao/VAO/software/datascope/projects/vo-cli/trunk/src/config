#  VOClient Tools Configuration file.   
#  v1.0  M. Fitzpatrick (fitz@noao.edu)         7/12/07
#
#       This file contains the configuration options for the VOClient
#  Tools package of tasks.  All tasks will read this file to ensure similar
#  behavior by the tasks.
#       Configuration data are stored as keyword-value pairs when boolean
#  flags must use a 'yes' or 'no' to indicate the value.  Strings are 
#  case-insensitive and '#' is used to indicate a comment to the end of the
#  current line.  Default values are listed as commented settings.
#       Additional options may be added in the future.
#
#  Supported options:
#
#       spawn           If set, will attempt to spawn a local instance of the
#                       voclient daemon if not already running.
#
#       port            Default port to use for a local voclient daemon.
#
#       console         Create a GUI console window for the local daemon?
#
#       quiet           Client API shouldn't produce any error output, it
#                       will be handled by the application.
#
#       server          VOClient daemon server address.  The address is of
#                       the form
#                                   <port> ':' <host>
#
#                       where <host> can be a local machine name, a fully-
#                       qualified domain name, or an IP address.  <port> is
#                       the socket number on which the 'voclientd' is running
#                       on that machine.  A server will be started if the
#                       'spawn' flag is set and <host> is 'localhost' or
#                       the current machine name, the <port> specified here
#                       will override the 'port' setting
#
#
# Default Values if not set below.
#
# port          6200
# spawn         yes
# console       no
# server        6200:localhost
