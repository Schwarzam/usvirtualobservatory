		     VO-CLI v1.0 Installation Instructions
		   =========================================


	VO-CLI is distributed as a GZip compressed tarball of either the
source, or pre-built binaries for a particular platform.  Current dist-
ributions include:

    vocli-src.tar.gz	    Source code distribution 
    vocli-linux.tar.gz	    Linux binary distribution
    vocli-osx.tar.gz	    Mac OSX (Universal Binary) distribution


See the README file for a complete list of the contents in the source
distribution.  Binary distributions will contain the following files
and directories:

    INSTALL		This file
    vodata		Task executable
    voregistry	 	  "	"
    vosesame	 	  "	"

    voclientd		VOClient daemon startup script
    voclient.jars	Supporting JAR files directory


Requirements Checklist:

    o  Task excecutables should be entirely self-contained, there are
	  no known specific requirements.
    o  The VOClient daemon requires that Java 1.5 be installed.
    o  The 'voclient.jars' directory MUST be in the same directory as
	  the 'voclientd' command script.


=======================
To Install from Source:
=======================


1)  Create a directory for the source, and unpack the distirbution tar file:

	% mkdir /path/vo-cli			    # create directory
	% cd /path/vo-cli			    # go there
	% tar zxf /path/vocli-src.tar.gz	    # unpack the distrbution

2)  Compile the package:

	% make					    # Do the compilation
	% make install				    # install to package bin

3)  Optionally, copy the binaries to a system directory.  In most cases
    this will require root permission in order to do it.  Assuming you
    want to install in /usr/local/bin, something like the following 
    command:

	% su					    # become 'root'
	# cp -rp bin/* voclient.jars /usr/local/bin # copy binaries


======================================
To Install from a Binary Distribution:
======================================

1)  Create a temporary directory to unpack the files:

	% mkdir /tmp/vo-cli			    # create temp directory
	% cd /tmp/vo-cli			    # go there
	% tar zxf /path/vocli-<arch>.tar.gz	    # unpack the distrbution

2)  Optionally, copy the binaries to a system directory.  In most cases
    this will require root permission in order to do it.  Assuming you
    want to install in /usr/local/bin, something like the following 
    command:

	% su					    # become 'root'
	# cp -rp * /usr/local/bin     		    # copy binaries
