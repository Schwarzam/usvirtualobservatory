<h2> Help for Simple Query pages </h2>

This page provides an overview of information on the SimpleQuery/TableViewer tool.
Additional information on specific fields is available by clicking on the
text labels for a field.

<h3> Query Page </h3>
On the query page you can specify the central position
and radius of a region to be searched.  The position
may be given as a target name or in J2000 coordinates.
<p>
If called without an specific resource specified,
a third input field is present where a knowledgeable
user can specify the IVO Identifier of the resource
to be queried.  Normally this service should be
invoked with the resource specified, but this mode
allows is useful for debugging.
<h3> The results page </h3>
The query results are downloaded and presented to the
user in an HTML table.  Users can scroll through, sort, filter, select
and propogate results.
<h4> Scrolling through results </h4>
The table results are scrolled using the page controls to the top
right of the form.  You can select the next or previous page, or a
specific page number.  The number of results displayed per page can
be changed.

<h4>Sort </h4>
Just click on a column heading to sort a table by that heading.
The first time the sort order is ascending; a second click on
the same column header will
start a sort in descending order.  An arrow will appear in the header
to show the current sort column.  Note that the entire table
will be resorted, not just the rows currently being displayed.

<h4> Filter </h4>
Enter a constraint in the box at the top of a column to filter the
table on that column.  E.g., if you want only the exposures greater
than 100000, enter <code>&gt;100000</code>  in the box.  As soon as you move
out of the box the table will be filtered.  Only fairly simple
sorts are supported.  &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;= &lt; can be used with
numeric columns as well as a range operator "..", e.g., <code>1000..2000</code>
to get everything between 1000 and 2000 inclusive.  If no operator
is specified '=' is assumed.
<p>
For character columns only fairly limited matches are supported.
A string column defaults to matching all rows that begin with
that start with that string.  If a '*' is included in the string,
it will match any set of characters (including none).  E.g.,
<code>3C*273</code> matches '3c273' and '3C 273'.  Character matching is
case insensitive.  The '=' may be used to request an exact match
rather than a starting with.  E.g., <code>=White</code> matches White but not
Whiteside while <code>White</code> would match both.
