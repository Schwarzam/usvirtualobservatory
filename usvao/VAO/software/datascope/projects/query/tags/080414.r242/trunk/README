Simple Query:

External Requirements:
	voclient (location defined in build.xml)

Required projects: (relative location defined in build.xml)
	net_nvo
	net_ivoa
	voview


The default values of this build.xml are

	ant -DINSTALL=/www/htdocs -DRUNTIME=/www/htdocs -DSUBDIR= -DVOCLIENT=/www/server/vo/080225 jar

(Please note that the default target is jar and not install.)

so the commmand

	ant install

will install the files relative to 

	${INSTALL}${SUBDIR}

For example,

	ant -DINSTALL=/www/htdocs -DSUBDIR=/jake/test install

will install in

	/www/htdocs/jake/test/vo/squery

and will respond to the server

	http://my.server.com/jake/test/vo/squery/query.sh

The RUNTIME variable is used here at heasarc because the installation for heasarc is done from heasarcdev and the files accessed during runtime are available through a different mountpoint and therefore a different location.  In this case, INSTALL=/www.prod/htdocs and RUNTIME=/www/htdocs.  This is seen from XSL files in the vo.settings file which is accessed from some java programs.  Most of the time INSTALL and RUNTIME will be the same, as they are when installing from heasarcdev for use from heasarcdev.

The SUBDIR variable is used here at heasarc for installing in subdirectories, primarily for testing.


Simple Query currently replaces voview's ...
	query.js - scientific notation
	filter.js - modified query.js requires modified call from here
	voview.xsl - so many reasons


Known issues:
	Reloading a web page with a VOTABLE will cause erratic behaviour

	Filterboxes do not show up on Safari, iCab, Shiira

	Filtering (when available) probably won't work on Safari as it xsl:import's

	Does not function on IE

----------------------------------------------------------------------

All the java is merged into ./tmp/source and compiled 
	into ./tmp/class.

Several of the scripts ant filter tokens like @VOCLIENT@.
	These tokens are replaced with a value defined in the build.xml
	during an ant copy.  This is very useful when installing during
	testing or installing in multiple locations.

Simple Query now pulls its external java source code from 
	../../net_*/trunk/src/java/ and combines it with its own
	java in ./tmp/source

It also pulls much of its javascript from 
	../../voview/trunk/src/javascript and 
	../../voview/{foreign,mod}/javascript/

It also pulls some of its xsl from 
	../../voview/trunk/src/xsl and 

voview is NOT exactly the same as Rick's
	voview.xsl contains the javascript converter code
	fsm.js has been merged with some of the features of the older
		version allowing the POST input as well as the xml
		processing callback
	voview.js contains modifications to use the modified fsm.js
	I am hoping that Rick will implement the same javascript
		changes, but I doubt that he will include the xsl
		(although I've asked)

sarissa.js has been upgraded to 0.9.9 and modified just as the previous
	version (0.9.8.1) was.
	I also required another suggested modification

The position conversion has been moved from xsl to javascript
	and a time conversion has been added.

All html has been corrected to pass as xhtml transitional

The ability to drag-n-drop columns has been added from Rick.
