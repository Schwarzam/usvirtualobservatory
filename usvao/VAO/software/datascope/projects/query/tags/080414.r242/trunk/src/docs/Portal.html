<h2> NVO Data Portal </h2>
This portal form lets you query VO tools easily.
There are two kinds of information you provide:
information that describes the data sources you
are interested in, and information that indicates
where in the sky you want to search these data resources.
Exactly what you can do in the portal depends upon which
of these you specify.  The portal services allow
you to browse and download VO datasets on the Web.
<p>
A set of <a href=''>VOCli</a> tools allows provides
comparable functionality for doing retrieval and analysis
from the command line.  Data source lists and lists of
positions can be interchanged between these two sets of
services.

<h3> Looking for Data Sources </h3>
You can limit the kinds of data sources you
want to search, by entering a list of one or more
keywords that describe the sources.  These might be
the wavelength, mission, author, or any other characteristics
you are interested in.  Metadata -- information describing
the data sources -- will be searched for any data sources
that have the keywords you specify anywhere in their description,
rather like Google searches Web pages.  You will get back a list
of the matching resources.  Just as with Google you are likely
to find that only some of the hits are relevant.  You will
get a form which allow you to filter and refine the list till
you have identified the data sources you want.
<p>
If you have already used the VO, you may have saved a list of
data sources in some earlier session.  You may reload this
list by clicking on the the 'List of Data Sources Link'.
<h3> Specifying a position or positions </h3>
If you just want to see what's known about a given position
enter a position where requested and submit
your request.  This will initiate a search of your requested position.
<p>
If you have a list of positions that you want to query, you
can click on the "Input source list" link and upload the list.
This will return a page which tells you how many hits you'll get
in various VO data sources.  You can then select one or more of
these data sources and find the data for your targets.
<p>
Whenever you get 'hit' list, you can filter it to get a list of
desired data sources.  E.g., you might wish to only look at a few
catalogs which match all or nearly all of your input sources.

<h3> Data sources and targets </h3>
If you specify both a data source and targets, then for a single
target normally the portal will begin to search the specified data sources.
If you specified an input list of positions, then you'll get the
number of hits in the given data sources for your targets.
<h3> Processing and getting data </h3>
Once you have a list of data sources and targets you can use
the VIM Portal Service to cross-correlate the results.  You can
use VIM or DataScope to download collections of data including
images and spectra that may be indexed by other sources.
