This tar is a hastily assembled collection of files
that are used in the Prototype SimpleQuery interface.

They come from a variety of directories in the HEASARC
area.  We describe them as they exist there but
other sites may prefer a different organization (in the
unlikely event that this early distribution will ever
be used elsewhere).

In /www/htdocs/vo/squery and its subdirectories
go static Web pages, Javascript, images, and CSS files.
Of these the javascript in the js subdirectory
is the most important.

/www/htdocs/cgi-bin/vo/squery has a set of CGI scripts.
These are generally very simple wrappers around either
Java applications or VOClient tools.

/software/jira/software/source/net/ivoa/query contains
some relatively simple Java classes that are used in
CGI scripts.

/software/jira/software/data/query contains data files,
notable some HTML templates and settings files, that
are used by the Java tasks.  It is assumed that
most of these will be in the same Jar as the Java commands.
