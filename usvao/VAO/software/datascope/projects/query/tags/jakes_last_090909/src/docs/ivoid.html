<h3>IVO Identifier</h3>
<br />
The IVO identifier uniquely identifies the data source being queried.
Normally this should be prefilled for when the simple query tool is called
from other services, e.g., the registry, but knowledgeable users may set
it explicitly.  The IVO identifier looks a bit like a URL.  Typically the
'host' name part of the id (between the // and first /) indicates the institution
that is providing the data, while the subsequent tokens denote the specific
resource within those the institution supports.

<code>ivo://nasa.heasarc/abell></code></p>
