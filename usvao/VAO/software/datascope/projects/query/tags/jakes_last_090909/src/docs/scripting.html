Users can query and retrieve data from the virtual
observatory using a variety of Web and CLI tools and libraries.
The VOClient package a relatively simple but straightforward
commands for getting data.  Users can submit lists of positions

like to query and the VOClient libraries can retrieve the data
in a variety of ways.  At any point in the Web interface you
can save your a list of selected data services or positions and
procede using VOClient.

Suppose you are interested in high resolution X-ray images of
rich clusters.  You go to the registry to find the Abell cluster catalogs,

query page.  You can filter on the richness or number of cluster
members to get the richest cluster.  Save this result as a VOTable,
to your local machine.  Now submit the command:
