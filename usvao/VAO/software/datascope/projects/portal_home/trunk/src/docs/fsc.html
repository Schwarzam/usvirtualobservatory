<h3> Which BM Type II Abell clusters near the south pole are in the
RASS FSC?</h3>

<ol>
<li>Start with the <a href=?page=bmii>search for southern cicumpolar BMII clusters</a>
<li>Export results to Inventory.
<li>The Inventory may do a search with a default radius.  After it returns 
enter 10' as the search radius and submit.
<li>Find the ROSAT Faint Source Catalog in the result. (use the Browser
search capabilities to look for the string FSC).
[I use the search feature on the browser to look for Faint]
<li> At total of only 4 clusters match.
<li>Click on the radio button next to the RASS FSC and
<li> click on the Find Matching Records.
<li>We see that one of the clusters (A3628) matches to 5 distinct X-ray 
sources.
Might be an interesting one to look at.
