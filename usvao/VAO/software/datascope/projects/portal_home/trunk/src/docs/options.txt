Have: An idea of the kind of data I am interested in.

Want: To find out what datasets are available.

Enter some keywords in the <a href='@Registry@'>registry</a> and take a look at what
results come back.  You should get back a list of matching resources.  Be more specific if you get too many results
or try alternative words if you are not seeing what you expect.  You can
view the descriptions for all resources, and if the data is queryable you
can search it directly with the Search Me link.

Want: To browse the datasets that match.

After querying the <a href='@Registry@'>registry</a> using keywords to find
what you are interested in,
just click on the Search Me links.  In the resulting forms enter a position where you expect to find
data, or just do an all-sky search. 

Have: Name of a table

Want: To understand what the table is about or where to find it

Enter the name of the table in the <a href='@Registry@'>registry</a> and view
the description and characteristics of the table there.

Want: To display the tables contents.

Enter the name of the table in the <a href='@Registry@'>registry</a> and get a list of matching
results.  Find the one you are interested in if there are multiple hits.
If you see a Search Me option, click on that and do an all-sky search in
the resulting form.

Want: To find the brightest, most recent, biggest, ... entries in the table

Enter the name of the table in the <a href='@Registry@'>registry</a> and get a list of matching
results.  Find the one you are interested in if there are multiple hits.
If you see a Search Me option, click on that and do an all-sky search in
the resulting form.   Enter your filter criteria in the filter box and hit return.

Want: To filter and cross-correlate this table with other tables in the VO

Use the <a href='@Registry@'>registry</a> to find the table. Filter the table using the Search Me option
and send the filtered result to VIM or the inventory.  VIM will allow you
to generate synthetic columns, but the inventory can do simple cross-correlations
faster.

Have: A list of objects.

Want: To convert the list to standard VO Formats.

You can try the <a href='@Translator@'>unsupervised</a>
Your table will be loaded and converted
and errors reported back to you.  You may need to edit the input a little.
It likes to have the RA and Dec columns named RA or Dec (with a few other choices),
and it's not too happy with rows with null values.

Want: To find other tables that have data near the objects in my list.

First convert to standard VO format as needed and then send the result
to the <a href='@Inventory@'>inventory</a> service. 

Want: To augment my table with data from matching resources including computed columns.

You may first want to check out the <a href='@Inventory@'>inventory</a> service to see which resources
will match your input table.  Select those resources and send them to <a
href='@VIM@'>VIM</a>.
Within VIM upload your original table.  VIM will allow you to cross-correlate
with each of the resources, merge the results into a single table, and create
columns based upon arithmetic combinations of existing columns.  You
can also filter the table at any time.
<br/>
Alternatively you can build up the table in the inventory service alone, but
will not be able to manipulate it or create synthetic columns.

Want: To display and filter a list.

If the list is in the standard VO format, just load it up in the <a href='@SimpleQuery@'>table
viewer</a>.  Otherwise convert it first using the table converter and then use the viewer.

Want: A set of images around that position

You can try this in <a href='@VIM@'>VIM</a> or you can use the <a
href='@VOCLI@'>VOClient</a> tool to download the
images in a command-line environment.

Want: To query another resource or set of resources around each position the
list.

Try the <a href='@VOCLI@'>VOClient</a> tools to run a query against a list
of input positions in the command line. 

Want: To display or filter a table that is already in VO format.

Upload the table into our <a href='@SimpleQuery@'>table display tool</a>.  You can
filter the table, do simple plots and save your filtered results.

Have: A single source or position

Want: To know everything about that position.

Use the <a href='@DataScope@'>DataScope</a> tool to download all the VO can find out and browse the results.

Want: To know what datasets include that position.

Just enter the position in the <a href='@Inventory@'>inventory</a> service.

Have: Multiple sets of targets

Want: To repeat the same task on each of the sets

The <a href='@VOCLI@'>VOClient</a> tools are designed
to allow you to easily script access to the virtual observatory.  You can
use the web tools for one or two trials, perhaps picking out the VO datasets
you want to use in your script.  Once you have picked out a list of datasets
in the the registry, the inventory, or DataScope you can download that list
and use it within you VOClient calls.  VOClient can create files which you can
upload into the Web tools if you want to browse results there, or you can set
VOClient to display in formats intended for human consumption.
