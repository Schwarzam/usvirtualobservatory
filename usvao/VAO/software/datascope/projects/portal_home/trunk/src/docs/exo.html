<h3> Find Exoplanet systems that have been observed by ST. </h3>

A link to a table derived from the <a href=nsted.ipac.caltech.edu>NSTED</a> database
of exoplanet data is available here.  While NSTED should be able to generate
a table in VOTable format, that didn't work when we created this search.
So we were able with a little manual editing to get a <a href=exostars.xsv>pipe-delimited file</a>
of all of the stars with known planets.  However we need to convert this
to a VOTable to use in the portal.  In particular we need to know
the RA and Dec, so we had to make sure that the RA and Dec columns were
something that our converter would recognize.  We edited the first row
of the table to make the names for those columns, RA and Dec.

<ul>
<ol>
<li>Get NSTed derived table (provided)
<li>Convert using TableConverter.  Note that the inventory doesn't like rows with nulls
in key columns.  And it needs to know which are the RA and Dec columns.
We've done the necessary filtering already in the linked file.
<li>Upload to inventory.  Do search radius of 1'.
<li>HSTAEC returns 57 matches or about 1/4 of the total.
</ol>
