<h3> How often has a point been observed by the active Great Observatories</h3>
The simple sequence

<pre>
    vodata -n hst     &1 &2 .02   2&gt;/dev/null | grep hst
    vodata -n spitzer &1 &2 .2    2&gt;/dev/null | grep spitzer
    vodata -n chandra &1 &2 .2    2&gt;/dev/null | grep chandra
</pre>
gives
<pre>
   hst                    238    C  Hubble Space Telescope
   spitzer                 23    C  Spitzer Space Telescope Observation Log
   chandra                 35    I  Chandra X-Ray Observatory Data Archive
</pre>
when <code>3c273</code> is input. 
The user can customize the search radius as needed since the different observatories
have different image sizes.  [For many shells you would use
a dollar sign rather than an ampersand to prefix arguments.]
