#summary Project Status as of 15 June 2010

= Design Page =

There is now a [http://code.google.com/p/voview/wiki/DesignIntro wiki page] describing the design documents for the proposed VOView redesign.

= filter Class =

I have begun coding of the filter class for the new design.  Everything is of course still in progress, but what I have done so far can be found in the repository under [http://code.google.com/p/voview/source/browse/#svn/voview-propose/trunk/src voview-propose/trunk/src].  I have written XSLT code for doing the filtering, and also the Javascript class for writing into the XSLT the column filtering expressions that are input from the interface.  

The filter class is where I will be continuing to concentrate my work in the near-term future.
