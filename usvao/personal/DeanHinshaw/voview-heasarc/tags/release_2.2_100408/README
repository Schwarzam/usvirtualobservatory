REQUIREMENTS

1) Installation requires that net_nvo be installed in the same directory 
(proj_root).  net_nvo can be obtained from the NVO repository.

2) VOView fetches VOTables by means of HTTP requests.  For this reason, VOView 
must be run under a web server, such as Apache.  VOView will not work properly
if run using a browser's internal file server.  Technically, you can install
VOView without a web server, but you cannot use VOView without a web server.

INSTALLATION

The default values of this build.xml are

	ant -Dproj_root=/www/htdocs -Ddest=/vo/view install

so the empty commmand

	ant

will do the same.

The files will be installed relative to 

	${proj_root}${dest}

For example,

		proj_root=/www/htdocs
		dest=/vo/view

	will install in

		/www/htdocs/vo/view

	and will respond to the server

	http://my.server.com/vo/view/
